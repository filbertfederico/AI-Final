I've also played Honkai Impact but I can say that they are nothing alike (this is good thing). Everything in this game is true to form for mIHoYo...top line production for everything--animation, music, art, voiceover, attention to detail some of the best. The world is truly OPEN and explorable. I am a very old school RPG player and have logged years into games such as Final Fantasy XI, XIV and many others (too many to mention) and I can honestly say that this feels very fresh and exciting even to me. The game presents encounters and events in like a D&D session in that they feel unexpected and thrilling. Players that are willing to explore the world will be rewarded. Although there is basic quest waypoints, the game does not autopath you. There's a small golden sparkle path and a basic direction icon. One of the most amazing things is how you can interact with the world. You are able to chop down small trees, climb larger ones (helpful to reach fruit that's up high) climb mountains to reach higher areas, even climb over walls in the towns. You can harvest and hunt in this game (and also cook the ingredients), and I would not be surprised if fishing is in there because there are fish in the waters, but they are very hard to catch by hand. I could go on and on. Way surpassed my already high expectations. The gameplay itself seems pretty basic action RPG style (3 basic moves, with charge ups) but with time perhaps this will become more fleshed out.

Steeping that aside. This game is literally the best game of the years and I'm not gonna lie, Some people complain about the lack of end-game content in it because they probably feel abyss isn't competitive enough. From my point of view, this game makes pretty balanced management in terms of content for the new or upcoming player, and old player. As an old player, I'm not invested a lot of time in the game right now, because I need to do other things. But when I came back to this game they still manage to brings me things to do, such as daily, new events, building houses in the teapot, achievements, etc. And then when you see the perspective of a new player that probably will invest more time, there is a lot of content to play, and then if you missed a lot of things since the release of the game, like event banner for weapon or char. the current and the upcoming banner, the old player probably won't need it but, I think is pretty friendly with the new players. So I really appreciate what the developers have done so far, but they still need to fix the damage of this anniversary disaster. but still, it's a 5 stars game for me.\", 'score': 5, 'at': datetime.datetime(2021, 10, 5, 11, 35, 30), 'appVersion': '1.6.0_2961400_3070488'}, {'reviewId': '791ad3eb-1cd0-4f57-ad6b-928853cdcee9', 'content': \"Amazing the detail is amazing.

This game is completely free to play and you can win the game and do everything that all the people that pay do. This game may need some more attention then your other games do because this game is new and updates will be frequent, you also need to keep in mind the game has limited time items from event, even if you don't get to the event in time - usually longer than a week - you can try to hope a event with the same items come again, I for one have missed an event for a character (Barbara-Hydro) but by the time I finished writing this review I got a Twitter notification that a event for my character (Barbara-Hydro) was available, so if you miss a event just hope the event hasn't been put out to may times already, but I the character you want just doesn't have and event for it you could also make some wishes to get your character! This game also has a large map (even bigger than most of my PC games maps), you can traverse to many places with different methods of transportation (Gliding, swimming and walking-gliding is only available after you finish the first couple tasks with Amber-Pyro)! The only issues I want to point out is that this has a large download file but it is worth it because of the syncing you can do with your other platforms (PlayStation, Desktop/Laptop, Switch-SoonToBe, and Mobile). The next issue I have is the massive power consumption, I only found out about this after my phone gave me and alert that the game was taking a lot of my phones battery so if your phone doesn't have a good battery then I advise you not to get the mobile app and instead get the console or laptop versions.

I've also played Honkai Impact but I can say that they are nothing alike (this is good thing). Everything in this game is true to form for mIHoYo...top line production for everything--animation, music, art, voiceover, attention to detail some of the best. The world is truly OPEN and explorable. I am a very old school RPG player and have logged years into games such as Final Fantasy XI, XIV and many others (too many to mention) and I can honestly say that this feels very fresh and exciting even to me. The game presents encounters and events in like a D&D session in that they feel unexpected and thrilling. Players that are willing to explore the world will be rewarded. Although there is basic quest waypoints, the game does not autopath you. There's a small golden sparkle path and a basic direction icon. One of the most amazing things is how you can interact with the world. You are able to chop down small trees, climb larger ones (helpful to reach fruit that's up high) climb mountains to reach higher areas, even climb over walls in the towns. You can harvest and hunt in this game (and also cook the ingredients), and I would not be surprised if fishing is in there because there are fish in the waters, but they are very hard to catch by hand. I could go on and on. Way surpassed my already high expectations. The gameplay itself seems pretty basic action RPG style (3 basic moves, with charge ups) but with time perhaps this will become more fleshed out. The English voice acting is actually very good, and that comes from someone that normally turns language settings back to original.\", \"score\": 5, \"at\": \"2020-09-29T01:43:13\", \"appVersion\": \"1.0.0_1112729_1135452\"},\n",

I have been playing this game from the initial release date and they do an amazing job with the story, character, fight, music, landscape. They always have new events and story quest every 6 weeks, you can play F2P as they are always giving the opportunity to earn free primogems. That's my favorite thing.... free primogems.

This game is completely free to play and you can win the game and do everything that all the people that pay do. This game may need some more attention then your other games do because this game is new and updates will be frequent, you also need to keep in mind the game has limited time items from event, even if you don't get to the event in time - usually longer than a week - you can try to hope a event with the same items come again, I for one have missed an event for a character (Barbara-Hydro) but by the time I finished writing this review I got a Twitter notification that a event for my character (Barbara-Hydro) was available, so if you miss a event just hope the event hasn't been put out to may times already, but I the character you want just doesn't have and event for it you could also make some wishes to get your character! This game also has a large map (even bigger than most of my PC games maps), you can traverse to many places with different methods of transportation (Gliding, swimming and walking-gliding is only available after you finish the first couple tasks with Amber-Pyro)! The only issues I want to point out is that this has a large download file but it is worth it because of the syncing you can do with your other platforms (PlayStation, Desktop/Laptop, Switch-SoonToBe, and Mobile). The next issue I have is the massive power consumption, I only found out about this after my phone gave me and alert that the game was taking a lot of my phones battery so if your phone doesn't have a good battery then I advise you not to get the mobile app and instead get the console or laptop versions. This is also a multiplayer game but there aren't any co-operative missions yet since this review and it is mostly just to level up and collect materials between each player/friend's world.

The content got so much more boring after the 1.8 patch. The Inazuma storyline was rushed and not as great as Liyue. It was still nice to experience. I've hated the Gacha system from the beginning but that's just part of the game I guess, but losing 50/50 is so annoying istg, also Mhy really does not listen to their players, it shows a lot. I hope we can fix that. Other than that, great game\", \"score\": 5, \"at\": \"2022-12-06T05:24:40\", \"appVersion\": \"3.2.0_10872902_11078128\"},\n",
