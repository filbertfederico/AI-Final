score,content
5,the game is great audio background etc are all great but one thing i do not like is the wish system i do not have a five star character all i have got are four star character so it is suck to be a free to play unless you save a lot or primogems one good thing about it is you do not need a five star character to beat and enjoy the game though i do need the mc though as she can upgrade her constellations with just lvling up rank or the story progress yeah it is hard to earn primogems i guess i better sucked it up
4,the world building characters art design and game play are fantastic and among the best in the genre the gacha mechanics are a bit egregious unfortunately i understand the developers deserve to be appropriately compensated for making a game of this caliber but rolling for characters is kind of a nightmare due to insanely low drop rates that do interfere with my enjoyment of the game otherwise this is a five star experience
4,this game is fun but at the time that fontaine was release my screen started to stop and now i cannot play anymore is there somehow any way to fix it i really wanna play i need help pleaseeeeee
4,this game is beautiful and the game is very fun and cool but the downloading recorces thing is annoying cause i have to wait for a really long time and it really frustrates me
4,lost on furina banner but all together it is a good game with nice graphics and gameplay
1,after years of waiting still no controller support for android so star still live on feels like apple has pay mihoyo to not giving android controller support scum apple or scum for both apple and hoyoverse even at four still no controller support for android heck you give starrail android controller support from the get go that further proven that you make a deal with apple
4,i love genshin but there is only one problem and its the fact you cant switch in between playstation and mobile pc which is really annoying as it would be great to be able to play with a controller without having to restart
4,awesome graphics if your phone can handle and render them xd when played for the first time it gives a whole different level of experience and controls are realistic with a top notch bgm and other sound effects very well built game by the developers
1,i do not know what is happening but when i clicked start game it said not enough storage and no matter how many apps i deleted it still said the same
5,the story is at peak level and not to mention the graphics i think its worth the size
3,ngl games great but my storage cannot keep up maybe something like having the choice to delete quest files before actually entering the game like these files take up like five six gb and my phone is kind of in the sweet spot of being able to download the game after quest files are deleted and cloud is not a good alternative for obvious reasons
5,this is a very interesting and long term story game with awesome characters storyline main story and terrain even though getting characters might be hard it is still perfectly enjoyable and comfortable with just our main character i definitely recommend
5,the games a very beautiful and the story and lore just gets intense after every update which i like if u want a fighting adventurous and lore game this is for u
5,it is amazing and it does have a weird fandom but i do not mind the problem is that i cannot always play because i keep logging off but i do not mind it since it does happen all the time overall the characters chef kiss and quality delicious i do hope that there will not be an ending to this game since it does have tons of theorys and lores which i love the most overall best game i have ever played play this game if you like guys and girls hehe
5,i soooooo love the game i played it since twenty twenty but i cannot play it anymore in my phone because of insufficient storage so i had to drop the game i will be back soon ig
3,the game is heavy if your using phone when playing this game can take half of your storage because there is a lot of update
1,i hate it when the screen turns black and i have to read what should be a cutscene the game is popular hard to believe they do not have the money for it
4,giving this game a four stars instead of five because the characters are amazing and even the graphics are gold but the stories that you have to complete is soooo boring and they are so bad and yet sometimes so hard to do and it takes forever to discover the new worlds but ethier way the game is pretty good i do recommend it if your only looking for good graphics and fighting
4,this game is very good they are very generous with the content however there are things that can be improved first the resin there are so many things to do here that requires resins raise the resin to at least forty or sixty and players will be happy second the rng ik the devs will probably do nothing about it but i really hope there is some way to make the rng a little bit better tt third please put a skip button sometimes like during the npcs event dialogues they make my head ache
2,so the game is great and all i was playing the game and streaming it but i myself ran into a problem you cannot do character creation and customization and i did not realise till later that you had to pay to level a character and weapons items not to be honest that part got under my skin so i literally stopped mid stream and decided i would not stream the game do not get me wrong the game is great and i did enjoy it for a bit until i realized i was not making money in game so yeah
5,i love this game sm it is really fun and the characters designs are so cool i really enjoy the newest region as well
5,i played this on the playstation i enjoyed it but it got hard to get items for leveling characters so i lost interest but was feeling nostalgic so i downloaded it on my cell phone so far it is exactly how i remembered it and the graphics are awesome and it is fairly easy to play
4,i have been trying to load into the game for over hours now and every time i try to start the game i have not even made it to the game yet it just says insufficient storage i have heard great things about it but i cannot even load in edit i got into the game on another device and it is amazing great graphics and storyline
1,after the new four update the game on my android pixel six pro is unplayable it lags so hard when i use elemental skills or bursts
4,it is a really good game but it is annoying how it now censor words like can and me and the fact that you can cuss and it does not censor it but other than that it is cool can you please fix this
5,please add controller support for android it is been years eight bitdo is even releasing an android genshin impact official chongyun controller so let us use it on android please
5,a really good game there is no flaws in storytelling the bosses are thrilling but not too sweaty and the gamplay is overall incredible
3,very fun game at the start rates are pretty abysmal though if you are looking for a game in which you get the characters and weapons you want look elsewhere with decent luck you can get a couple you want if you save for an entire year do not play the game if you want good updates that are not just focused on dialogue not actual gameplay if you want endgame content this game sucks if you want to not grind for hours on end every day just to lose your this game sucks do not recommend
1,when came this game is does not let me enter i keep restarting my phone and tried a many solution but still did not work i am stuck at the geo sign loading screen and it warning me that ui is not responding pls fix this hoyoverse many people too having this error especially those who are low storage i love this game but it so laggy and keep crashing and now i am stuck at the loading geo sign
5,it helped me through a lot when i was younger and it still helps me now and even efficenter place it is still the thought that counts and it always make sure to go after the thing that you need the most liked how she needed her brother david remind you to always believe in yourself
5,awesome game so far great graphics and runs smooth just wish i could use xbox controller without having to pay for an app using android
5,honestly this game is very fun to play in my opinion when i am bored i just play this game and i get so into it i sometimes rage quit you can play with friends and play in co op mode once you reach a certain level i love this game and the fandom the characters are all equally unique and the plot is super cool overall a amazing game and totally recommend if you like anime
1,i have played this game since it is second anniversary and i must say it was a fun experience until the bliss faded and i saw it for what it truly is a cash grab no good events tedious story horrible rng and most of all the pity system and the complete lack of empathy for the free to play players it says third anniversary but it is really just two ten pulls that is it no love or effort other gaacha games give more but this this is just utter garbage save yourself do not play this trash
5,for me genshin impact is perfect good story concept excellent world events and graphic i also love the fact that you can thrive even being a free to play player so spending is your ultimate choice not an obligation i love this game so much well done
5,i have gotten really far in this game and i gave to say it is amazing it is ftp friendly and it is just the right amount of challenging
5,this game is so addicting for me i was playing this game and i had a lot of fun this game has good quality the characters are really great they had the quality needed kaeyas voice is a bit like shawty nahh hahaha just kidding the story is interesting for adventurers it explains all the game is equal and fair although i had no experiences playing with such a lagging game idk why but i am annoyed because i never played such an exquisite game i can say is that it has a very good quality
4,this game is very amazing the new update is cool fontaine is also breathtaking and the underwater mechanics are amazing too but whenever i try to log in to play the geo icon takes so long to load please fix it
4,it is good so far but it keeps kicking me out i was in the middle of fighting and it kicked me out it is annoying but good game
4,it has good characters and pretty epic story but i think resin cap should be higher since it is getting added to star rail too co op experience is not great but i guess it is ok it is a good game you can choose whether you are just playing for lore comat or to just wish for characters you like
2,the game is fun but i really wish the drop rate was improved i wanted the get the five characters but the pulls are so bad the wishing system is bad i do not wish to spend so much to get a five character i get nothing but weapons and maybe just maybe a four character this needs to be improved a little
5,thanks for the game this game exists years he have big history with many character in open world this is casual game but people can try breast abyss waifu gaming it first place
2,genshin is a fun open world game with a ton of fun things you can do you can battle explore play with your friends etc however the amount of storage this hame takes up my phone is nearing sixtygb due to the new regions and updates it requires its players to download dont get me wrong the lore and story makes it worth it but i think mihoyo should limit the amount of gigabytes needed for mobile players to download i love the game but many people quit bc of this exact reason
5,you guys have no idea how much i love this game soooo much whenever i see merch or cosplayer i would scream the top of my lungs the style characters stories graphic adventures they are all awesome please keep updating so players would not get bored although we might get problem if we used android i do not really care as long as it is genshin impact or hoyovers game i would likely recommend please do not ruin my expectations and never change my mind have a nice day suki
5,hey the game is great i have felt no problem like bugs or glitches but can you guys optimise genshin for the samsung a fifty four or exynos eighty i would greatly appreciate it
5,i have been playing for a year and a half now this game is reakky good and all but today i just encounter a problem which i cannot log in my acc through fb it keep showing something went wrong please fix this hoyo i want my acc back
5,nothing to say this is my first time play it and i never see it on yt or any platform just this game always show up in ads game so i tried it maybe i play little longer to know about this game
1,waiting for one day that it successfully play on phone with smooth no lag and no over heating my phone but too bad it should not be mobile game anymore have fun outside play with friends but our phones cannot handle it the new map is burning your phone when only gaming thirty mins around play in low graphics also cannot help much all u get are only lag with heating and nearly burning phone better play on pc which requested eighty to one hundred gb to download it but still better play on phone
5,it is an absolute fun game i enjoy it so much i love the graphics and everything about this game keep up on the updates
5,hi can you guys fix the issue that has been there a long time ago its the dmg icefield and grass on android arent showing hope it get fixed
5,i love the art style and story if this game it looks so good and the story of this is just great especially when you get characters st the beginning of the story this whole game is just great in many different ways
1,its a worst game ever i played for four months for kazuha i did not got even a good piece set for kazuha they really test patience untill we give star review i am ar fifty five level wish event is waste i did not got even a five star character in low pity battle pass is unaffordable
4,this game is the best online adventure mobile game the map is so cool and the monsters and bosses are strong enough to have fun while playing alone or with your friends you can upgrade your characters as you want and the grafic are cool but my problem is with the space why all this space and it downloads a lot maybe half an hour to only enter the game but beside this it is fantastic game
5,it is really amazing for a phone game free to play and no ads i wish i could rate it above five stars it is currently my favorite game it has a huge area to explore many awesome quests characters and things to do
5,i love genshin been playing it for a year now i must say its an expensive game you need a good device to play the game since its very heavy on graphics but all in all the theme song and the lore is very amazing its just hard to earn primogems when you are lazy and an free to play haha
2,the best parts are the exploration and the fighting mechanics but to get the best out of those you need to do unnecessarily huge amount of grinding i also feel like this came has the biggest identity crisis since it is trying to be rpg but none of the dialogue options affect the course the game rhythm game gacha game card game cooking game decoration game dating sim detective game and whatever they decide to pull of
3,it is a known problem but having fewer chances to pull the character you wanted is giving me more reasons not to play regularly pity system is also very frustrating as it may vary from zero to ninety pulls it would be better if even it is at least thirty to fifty pulls to trigger pity
5,good game like the story line you can do what you want in the middle or the quest as it does not force you to walk a path and head straight to the quest area
5,this game has some lags but every thing else is perfect the characters are stunning and they have backstorys forcing me to the end of my seat this game is amazing with lots of adventures to do
2,the new update has been taking a lot of time to load but now it just freezes once it has finished loading and exits the game just like that i love genshin but i am really frustrated because i have not been able to play for days now
5,good graphics voice acting is good good fighting system and so much more
5,absolutely love this game the scenes and graphics are great the open world map is beautiful but i play on my phone so i have to delete a lot of stuff to get the updates still love the game though
4,i had a great time while playing but the new updates reset my progress it is my fault since i did not log in yet but i am just a bit upset about it
3,genshin is a very wonderful game but it is becoming boring i hope you can add some more useful settings like more sensitivity limit and more useful dodge mechanics because dodging is very dull and pointless because of very op shielders and reduce enemies attack intervals to give us time to react and i hope you can add some camera distance option while sprinting and better targeting system like in star rail and hi to avoid confusion in battle and more camera combat options just my suggestions
5,the world is amazing the story and the characters if you want to play this on mobile make sure your phone has enough storage i play on pc but placing on phone is also nice since i can play anywhere i like
2,game is way too focused on whale players not everyone can pull one hundred wishes on every most banners fate points reset is by far the worst feature here makes me want to stop playing at all
1,greedy company that does not reinvest into the game to keep its experiences fresh and fix in game lip sync with voice lines will only get worse over time
1,you have lost your touch thanks for making traveler the most boring mary sue to exist not only the story have been of low quality but the limited timed events seems poorly planned as well this game had so much potential and now it is gotten bland and boring
1,i overall love the game but i couldnt get into the game i am currently installing this game again to see if it was a glitch but i really hope i can play this game
5,i am using oneplus nord ce lite five g and it is smooth and great fps and although it take nearly twenty to thirthy five gb of space out my phone it is still normal and wonderful performance ram eight plus four gb so i have nearly no lag but there is lag but only after two hours of constant gameplay wonderful and free to play game does not require money to be spent on the game relax and spent some time to go forward with the game by playing free to play characters
3,love the game play and the character design is amazing but i cannot play the game anymore because it takes up to much storage and is getting bigger
5,for years of years i searched this type of game like great graphics great storyline just enjoy and feel its adventure explore the world to get everything you need and for heros practice makes everything perfect like use the bow one for distance kill and you don t have to pay any kind of money but you can if you have primo deficiency or just want the best characters for you there are no flaws in this game generally thank you hoyoverse to create this masterpiece
5,best game everything will go smoothly if your device can withstand the insane storage consumption and the graphics my advice to mobile players is to lower your graphics to the lowest that way you can enjoy smooth gameplay smoothness over graphics if you would ask me if you have a potato phone then condolences tbh
4,it is is a good game but i deducted that one star because i think the spiral abyss is hard it is hard for new players to experience it how are you gonna expect a new player that has to do combat in a time limit but not get the rewards at a certain time stamp please hoyo thank you
5,d open world adventure highly recommend this game as it is really fun and the ads are not lying ten over ten
5,cannot get enough of this game just wish we could dress our characters more especially the traveler and pet play hold the dogs and cats but other than that i love playing and swimming lol
3,it is a bit hard to use for newer players and i am glad it is not like pick the male treveler if your a male and pick the female traveler if your a female
2,if by chance i do not play this game for to four days it just keeps on downloading for ten to forty five minutes it is just so irritating
5,game is very good graphics are totally mind blowing environment is amazing controls are smooth you can play with multiple characters as you progress in the game
4,i love the game the characters the map and the lore i really do the update has made it rather insufferable playing it though there is a glitch that happens regardless of whether or not i uninstall restart the game midway battling say the oceanid it is hp is down to half all of a sudden the battle stops and disappears when i do a rebattle it becomes × difficulty wasted my items i still love the game though just hard to get resources to level up the characters when this happens
5,good game great graphics reminds me of zelda but the new update messed up the game everytime i try to log in it kicks me out the game
1,great game as a whole but unfortunately it has a lot of drawbacks it has the worst launcher in the world as you can have a steady twenty mb connection but it will always fail to download and you will find yourself downloading from the start again and again it has farming issues resin and a lack of end game content as i find myself with no quests no exploration no content to keep me busy playing the game and no resin to keep farming for my characters
2,october one the game exceeds all expectations of a free to play game the voice acting is incredible the animations are gorgeous and the world is so big bug in co op i cannot enter dungeons even after meeting recommended level requirements around adventure rank thirty progress slows dramatically four over five stars october twelve this is a soul sucking game with a zero point six percent chance at five star hero and not enough variety to keep it interesting gameplay becomes repetitive with endless fetch quests it was fun while it lasted
3,the game and new update is beautiful and amazing i do enjoy exploring around but the issue i have encountered was when i teleport to a certain waypoint then my game crashes i had to use another device to open it again and teleport away and then in the middle of the archon quest the second part where we are underground with navia and the headquarters my game crashed i do not know what caused it but i hope it gets fixed
3,it is sad that star rail is far more better then genshin now i wished they would be like them it is ok to add more end game events and give us increase resin star rail has higher resin cap man i wished they add all the things in star rail to genshin impact please put it in genshin impact
5,i love genshin it is amazingg its graphics its storyline the characters the wishing and the free primogems we get when mihoyo reaches a goal its amazingg
5,this is the best open world game you can travel and see other players it like you are in real world like anime series being isekai everything in this game is so goood
5,great characters and mechanics for adventuring and wandering in the expansive world of teyvat my daughter and i really enjoy this game
4,wish you can use an xbox controller like on the iphone version but the frame rate is better on android i would definitely give it five stars once u can connect third party controllers to play i like to cast to a tv and play when i travel
1,the new event does not even work properly the enemies will not spawn but the timer still runs
5,today i got around one hundred mb update but it keep going seventy eight finished then again it is go to fifty it keep doing like this i waited half hour but still it not finished please fix this bug this is second time happening with me and first times also happen with similar small update i cannot even play game i cannot even re download game because the game sizes it too big please give me solution or i have to download again full game i do not have wifi i am using mobile data so you can imagine how much time it wi
4,the game is amazing but i have been trying to get in the game but it says i do not have enough storage after i cleaned out my junk files it still did not let me in
5,this game is a perfection unimaginable that this is available on android the game is huge even onehundred x larger than all gta combined
4,this is a great game for the first week but after that there is just too much dialog if i want to do anything i need to go through about five minutes of dialog it is just not as fun anymore but other than that it is a really great game i would definitely recommend it if you are patient enough to suffer through the dialog also c kequing is not funny
4,the game looks great i had issues at first when the game was released but now it is running better than ever i just wish there was controller support for the android version i mean there is a pc and playstation version that support controllers but not the mobile version weird
4,this is awesome the graphics work for my device the games voice acting is good as well
4,imagine you come home from school stressed tired and depressed your dog just died because your family cannot pay the vet bill you log into genshin impact your favorite game ever to find solstice you manage to get to seventy five pity and can get a limited five star your favorite character you lose your to qiqi c you cry because your life is helpless hopeless and depressing make atleast my favourite game more forgiving i use this game to have fun to escape not be depressed let me run
1,i need that hoyoverse release a software for gamepads on android i can believe that we already had this game for years and we still cannot play with controllers on android
5,i really enjoying this game even i do not mind the quality lag so well i see i like the characters and the religion map also i like the offcial art and is very fun to play it i do not have a single the most hate characters i really love all of them the song was to entertaining to listen to
5,for me this game is one of the best open world games exploration is so fun there is a lot of quests that are fun and ones a little less overall there is always something to do in genshin characters are beautiful and lore is amazing as well totally recommended
3,it is good but i think we should remove the sufficient space on genshin impact because i was clear the storage and its show again i was trying to play with my friends
5,it is one of the best gacha games you can come across there is always something to do in new updates and the character design is so amazing the only problem i have is the resin cap but besides that this game is absolutely amazing
5,by far my favourite game in the past i have always struggled to stay consistent with games but ive played genshin everyday since i downloaded it its endlessly entertaining quests about characters or history of certain places just deepen my interest with the game i can whole heartedly say that even when the storyline ends im still gonna play awesome game
5,i have been playing for a year and all i could say is bravo again hoyoverse you have outdone yourself again the game so far is amazing no bad thoughts so far the lore background music characters all amazing and detailed
5,my quests are not showing up on the right of my screen i have quests here and no idea where to proceed because navigate doesnt work please help me there is issue with the game
5,as a new player it is really good overall good graphics storyline and at least for me has a good balance if you prefer the adventures or the story this game will be best if people play at a high storage phone or pc
5,it is a lot of fun i like that you get different characters with different attributes to use the dungeons have been fun and i am so glad there are waypoints i also like i can upgrade characters wherever i am at as long as i have the things required and love enhancing my weapons not gonna lie i am addict
5,this is five star for cuz this game it is so adventure and it so good about your graphic and it is look smooth about the screen and that is all thank you
5,this is the best open word game by a looong shot the devs here have done outstanding job at creating a world thats actually interesting and filled with rewarding quests and puzzles apart from the main missions content which btw is fire is added regularly so you are never really bored unless speedrunning exceptional storyline man this game is peak
4,this is an excellent game it is very fun to play this game but i do not like that i cannot get an five star out of the banner except diluc
5,i am sure this is a brilliant game but i was not able to log in or register because my password may be an error and when i try to register the verification code will not show up
3,yes i like the genshin impact but i will only give it stars because of the nahida and kaveh glitch that hoyo has not fixed yet and i want it fixed because they say it is permanent and the glitch cannot be reversed even if log in again or redownload this is scary because if they do the glitch the heroes or other characters may not be able to level up because of the glitch hoyoverse if you can see this i hope that you have fixed the glitches that other players do not want to happen thank you
5,my favorite game of all time has amazing lore and characters and graphics and you can see that the people working on this game put a lot of effort into this game and the world this story takes place in isnt just split two sides like here are the good guys here are the bad guys instead there are many sides and its a bit hard to tell wich side is on the wrong and wich side is lying about being on the right the gameplay and game is amazing and is definitely my favourite game of all time
2,good game but sincerely hope game become less popular and more players quit so i can get higher chance to win limited reward from their contests more players mean less reward after all
4,i like the game the graphics and game play are great however it is very grinds and sometimesmost of the time it feels like a a cash grab which most gacha are so that is fine i stopped playing a month after summeru because of how much gigabytes it took and i am reinstalling to see fontaine and i swear to god if fountains is behind an ar fifty level wall like iwazuma i will uninstall and rate stars i still like the game
5,what else do i have to say this is an absolute masterpiece the osts are very relaxing or very intense the characters are easy to attach to the gameplay is insane and the lag is nonexistent which is incredible for a five gb game
4,good but i got i problem every time i run an app and try to log in it says no network available wi fi is good what is going on
3,update death by dialogue i use to love this game the story was immersive and it was about the game play now it is all overly long irrelevant side stories and fillers pot and card game are a waste of the developers time get back to what was good exploration plot and fighting
4,the animation of the game is just amazing its story line is quite suspenseful which makes it even more interesting
5,it is so fun and the characters were so cool i mean i find it boring at first because of fighting with some strong opponents but i got used to it
4,the story is really great gameplay wise its eight over ten very repetitive if you are done with the story you have nothing else to do but farm
5,i love this game such breathtaking views sometimes they even make me stay afk enjoying the beautiful scenery and music anyway the character designs are perfect oh and the new update is quite good
1,i loved it so much but i am disappointed now i need to delete almost everything on my tablet just to make room for this game i understand that it is a big game but you guys seriously need to optimize the file sizes star i think i speak for almost every mobile player when i the fonatine file size is outrageous i wasted so much money and time on this game and im one of the unlucky people who does not have a pc or playstation to switch too it is unplayable at this point i am so disappointed
5,hoyo give me my ten wishes back it ate my ten pulls while i am lagging did not got anything back i would really appreciate it if you fix this little bug that i found out from a player named yasha btw heres five stars in my other accounts this games great when i am not lagging
5,this game is really fun and a neat adventure game it has a good story and awesome characters with very fun ways in combat they all have very different ways to fight personalitys and apearences if you enjoy lore story and adventure i would recommend
1,gameplay is great music is awesome character design is fantastic but through inazuma they just got lazy with story development but they redeem themselves with sumeru story dialogue however are pretentious and too lenghthy no skip nor story archive milestone reward anniversary new patch etc is pure joke zero respect for its player base the rng for artifacts is just basically punishing player for playing the game the grind is horrible you can farm and grind for months for zero progress
3,a good game definitely even though almost everything on console pc is better mobile still holds up for when you are on the go and do not have access to the superior resources to play
2,love this gameso much but i am upset android users seem to always have problems with the game lagging out horribly iphone can work without wifi and does not lag once but an android cannot function genshin without wifi for even five seconds before kicking you android has always lagged a bunch too i have tried different androids that all lagged and would not function off of mobile data every iphone did not have even one problem
2,it just keep crashing even tho i have more than enough storage space and got the lowest graphics on but it still keeps crashing the fps is on four but the gameplay looks like it got frame per seconds and then crashes i cannot restartgdnshin because i do not have wifi i only play genshin with data so mihoyo please fix this crashing issue
3,the game is good there is alot to explore and to do and so is the details but the reason i gave it a stars is because the account that i have been using for thus past few months disappeared i dont know how but all my hard works also disappear which means i have yo restart everything i lost interest since i have to restart all i did pls fix this
4,when i first installed this game i thought its would be a fun free roam game to play in my free time and i was sure right the only bad thing i would say about this game is that it is really hard to level up and the amount of exp it requires other than that it is a great game
5,one of the best games developed ever a cross platform game that enables players to continue their adventure whenever and wherever they may be a co op available feature that makes genshin impact one of the few mmorpg that can be enjoyed together with friends and family superb back ground music out of this world graphics player abilities to jump run swim and now even dive underwater truly remarkable by mihoyo
3,still no android controller support my old iphone has controller support but i guess they do not care about android the game is standard gacha fair you can get lucky and pull some op characters or be like me and spend hundreds to pull mostly junk oh well i used to enjoy the game and do not mind throwing them some money but no controller support years after release when the game is on consoles and has controller support on ios is inexcusable
3,the game is amazing and good to play highly recommend but i have to say when i try to update the game it is not allowing me to update it and when i finally updated the game the background music was so glitch it sounded like a robot and now it is hard for me to play wish i could sad i cannot but other than that you should definitely play just be careful so you do not break it
1,keeps lagging even with low settings my game keeps freaking out and glitches terribly idk what to do besides wait hours to reinstall it and uninstall it constant flickers
4,good game wish there was better camera control especially for mobile users i keep getting my camera plunged in to the grass whenever i get hit in combat and the sensitivity to pull the camera back to normal is such a hassle especially if ur trying to stay alive pressing other buttons
4,we need controller support for tablets i do not want to keep using third parties apps the game is alright been years playing and no controller support whatsoever
1,talking about game technically so far i have no problem but the story line is not good especially the part where you add or describe characters as gods and you have to choose worship in order to gain benefits of game i really really wish if that wasnt the case games should be devoid of religion the religion aspect of fantasy makes people like me who are faithful to one religion very uneasy kindly dont make games based on religious fantasy so thats why i am uninstalling it
5,its a very nice game an open world where you can travel different places what i would like to ask if its possible incorporate a open microphone during coop with your friends that would be really fun
5,hoyoverse i love this game so much for my whole life cause this game has chill vibes interact with attractive characters slaying enemies grind for artifact and many more it makes my day a lot and i have been enjoying it a lot when i played it keep up the marvelous work hope to see more excitement in throughout the whole updates and in the future as well
5,it is really a wonderful game but this past days i have been experiencing some error the loading screen take too much time and i cannot even play it no it is not my cp cause i have fifty sixgb and eight gb ram it is just will not let me in the game i refreshed it but nothing i hope you will fix this it is really a good game and it will be a shame if i will delete it
5,it takes me back on the ragnarok feels back in two thousand i enjoy the story the quests and the anime style
5,overall this game have a nice performance the quality the graphic are not bad as for the story and lore i would give it a ten over ten bc they are very interesting and does have a good plot
3,i have always loved you game but one day yall had to change the ascension quest and now it is getting harder for some players like me to ascend yall please bring back to old ascension quest it was much better
5,played and it was great however i would love the pity system to be lowered to at least seventy five pity per five star and also we only get resin per eight minutes i wish we could at least get resin instead of one and the resin cap is sixty but i think it should be at least twohundred because one daily boss takes up forty resin and you only get boss drops per boss i am ar fifty six
4,i really like this game even though i do not like any others under hoyoverse and i have been playing on a new account after my last one was deleted it is super easy to get used to the controls but i still wish you could connect a keyboard or controller and still play on that also the rendering is very slow and it often disconnects me without warning
3,i love this game but can you guys please add a login with google option on all platforms the game is too big for my phone but i really wanna play i want to be able to log onto my account on my computer
4,beautiful game ten over ten for me after playing every day for months i lost all my progress and the game sent me back to character selection i tried starting over but piamon voice started to get annoying so i removed the app
1,after the latest update the adventure rank ascension three become so hard all character have max up still cant pass the level the time limit is to short all characters lvl eighty weapon lvl eighty artifact lvl seventeen to twenty talent all up to lvl six
3,the game is alright it is just eat up lots of space but it is now good also it is a bit laggy to my two phones i use to play this but it is somehow fun to play
1,this game does not respect ur time these unskippable story plays line at a time and are stupid and shallow it is a pain to go through also the devs sens of games difficulty is just give enemies more hp or give them five sec invincibility to stall for spiral abyss also recently the abyss enemys can oneshot heros out of the blue devs are not skilled enough to make a good combat system and the artifact farming is a pain the worst of all the game lags like it is running a powerpoint slide
5,love this game there is so much to do and explore i just cannot get enough though the great game play and graphics do have a downside if i play too much or for too long my phone will heat up and i have to take a break and when i mean long i mean like twenty to thirty minutes but other than that it is a great game and i really enjoy it and recommend it to anyone who loves an action packed game
5,the best open world game i have ever played perfectly balanced game especially it is a free to play game which does not require any money to play i am loving the contents of the game
3,four point nine over five for desktop and one over five for mobile it is not very optimized for mobile you will need to download like anywhere from twenty to forty gb of data after downloading the app from the app store and only half of the entire story has been released i would hate to see how much storage this game will cost in a few years i would not be surprised if it hits one hundred gb
5,this is one of the best games ever i absolutely love the graphics the characters and everything else i do wish i could transfer data onto other servers but overall this is amazing
4,i love it but when i got a new phone and installed it on that phone my old account kept crashing it works on a new account but i want to use my old account i dont know what to do i love the game the graphics are great the lore is great too
4,i have played since week and i love this game so much especially since my wife and i can play together the characters are so fun crazy and mysterious and the story just keeps you wanting more i do wish theyd fix the artifact grinding somehow because i dont even bother with domains anymore i also really wish theyd add another shop slot for a character because there are so many four stars that ill never see because the banners just will not give them to me please mihoyo its been years
5,i always thought why people were talking about it so much but now i understand although it needs five gb space in total it is worth it i have been playing it for nearly hours straight it is so fun and immersive i greatly recommend if it is possible for you to download it
5,genshin is amazing no question any game so popular will attract some hate but anyone can see within the first five min playing the game it is really damn good my only complaint is the inability to skip cut scenes
4,i have encountered a bug so when i log in to my main account after downloading the resources it lets me right however when i have not downloaded the resources to my other account it makes me download it and when i try to go back to my main account it makes me re download the resources please fix it because i just want to log in fast thank you
5,this game is amazing the graphic the story line the characters and so many other things is really well made
5,i have played this game since the release and i used to enjoy it but after playing it for a while i cannot deny that the story writing and it is execution is getting downhill the lore is deep and intricate but the way the main story is presented is laughable most of the characters who have potential wasted just like that honestly i do not even understand why the quest must be fast paced like that it was just very underwhelming
5,graphics are awesome and that story style is too good english dubbed that not too bad but japanese dubbed voices are so my awesome and that gives a anime life vibes
2,legend of zelda breath of the wild but on phone and more anime d aka probably the best thing ever but also the saddest thing cuz it becomes boring with this much content and no catch up to the story i fell behind on the main campaign and i am less motivated to catch up with it due to hours and hours and unskippable boredom
4,great update new battlepass weapons new artifact craftables new features the only remaining problem is let us top up on any device aside from the device that we created our account it will be a matter of time before my playstation break down i hate it when i have to open up my playstation and update for every new version just to buy battlepass there please let us top up on any device please
4,good game but not really five stars would say that the game file size is getting a bit too big with customisations and all and four more story plots regions yet to be released at this time the developers could consider optimising by making a part part of the game on mobile devices splitting the regions on each part of the game with shared account access information on characters inventory and event maps
5,i have been playing genshin for over a year now it is such am amazing game the stories are well writen the new lands they add r just great and always adds new things such as puzzels and new stories it is just great
5,a perfect game with a bit of everything keep up the amazing work you all ad astra abyssosque
4,the game is awesome and very beautiful and creative but whenever i am playing on my laptop paimon always says that i fell into abyss which i was in land and not near the barrier but overall it is a good awesome game but i cannot play pls fix this hoyoverse i really want to keep playing this game
4,have not played in a while so i had to update it and now i can seem to get on my account all my characters gone what the hell i still have my uid ive sent a email to cs support to no avail
5,i have been playing this game on pc for over a year and i just adore it the character designs are so imaginative and the actual world design is bright and beautiful the graphics are amazing and i love how immersive the plot is five stars i would recommend
4,it would be wrong to classify genshin impact as a mobile game has stunning graphics quality with environmental detail emphasizes on the gacha system a lot but there is not any need to spend money on the game however it is good as a side game or casual game not something you would play for hours
5,best game i have ever played it is like you are are watching an action pact series while at the same time experiencing it first hand graphics
2,the game is great but storage is a big problem i have deleted all past quest resources and only have one language downloaded along with storage it is very easy to get burnt out later in the game the new fontaine update is leaving very little space on my phone
3,the events and characters are fun to play and all but it frustates me that android only have one method of playing even ipads have two options touchscreen and controller i hope that keyboard and controller will come as an option for mobile gaming in the future
5,what a nice game though it is a bit hard to catch up now with the storyline its been alright
2,i am seriously disappointed i love everything about genshin but when i am finally able to download this game i need over twenty something gb and for what i am sorry to say but this game is becoming more and more inaccessible for every person who wants to play it if you want more people to play genshin please make it more acessable i cannot even download it on any of my other devices i would not recommend
5,for new players reading these reviews trying to understand if genshin is worth it all of those memes a few years ago about it being cringy and stupid are total lies the game is not cringy at all and the characters and story and gameplay and community are awesome the android version unfortunately does not run super well so i would recommend getting a backup device if you are ever in a pinch and say run out of storage but overall a spectacular game
3,great game unfortunately file size is too large for my phone fifty gigs i am unable to play on my phone or buy primogems because of lack of storage uninstalling they really should look at removing game assets as you complete questing and such warning if you plan on playing fyi please get it on pc first otherwise you will be locked to your phone app in terms of buying in game items the game will not let you purchase things outside of mobile if you started in mobile
3,it is a nice game i hadnt played it yet bc my screen is still loading i gave it three stars because of the how long does it take to update the game the app tho am not mad i swear
2,this is a wonderful game please do not play it the music the artsyle the combat the really cool charaters make it an amazing product in an awful gacha package new content is added bit by bit and bit was an exaggeration here what do you do in between updates you grind but cookie i do not want to grind i will just skip that well you want your cool characters right and you want them leveled up right in that case pay up hoyo controller support when
1,i love this game so much but now everytime i try to enter in the pc it just freezes before it can even start loading
4,i was forced to play this game anyways its nice i would play it either way i recommend you play it aswell took a while to load but its fine it took a lot of my storage
1,guys i really like this game please make it more cheaper thouu the odds of getting a five star character is really hard
5,yall this would be the best game that you will ever play story line is excellent graphics are awesome
4,this a very good game have astonishing graphics and cut scenes there is only issues i have this gets laggy and game developers please add a pvp mode as well that will be amazing
5,the game is amazing i love the fighting style of the game the graphics everything keep up the good work
5,absolutely amazing the best game i have ever played beautiful storyline character designs massive open world and beautiful graphics i one hundred recommend especially with the upcoming region fontaine although takes so much storage currently storage for mobile is thirty six gb and pc is sixty gb
4,started like a years ago idk but this game had me playing every single day its really fun with all the graphics the lore and the character designs that its so like unique compared to other games i have played so far the storage has been quite the issue and complicates quests or probably im just dumb but overrall its such an amazing game and i love it
3,as a mobile and an old pc user i really do reccomend this game to people who dont know what game to start playing one thing is when i joined on my old pc at everything started to lag and honestly this was not enjoyable i lost storage at the six update but then got a new phone and started playing i cant wait for and fontaine high hopes on genshin impact
3,material grinding and talent materials are too hard and annoying to get and my lucks sucks so bad which i cant even get a single artifact or weapon neither a good character
5,amazing experiences wonderful graphics amazing gameplay amazing stories amazing characters overall for me this is one of the best game i have ever played although the storage needed for this game is killing my phone its stil amazing as ever if your a big fan of open world rpg and adventure this game is one of the best really recommended ten over ten
5,i have found no major issues with this game as time passes it just keeps on getting better it does take up a lot of storage but that is understandable considering the graphics quality i have been playing this game for years now and have no plans on stopping
5,this game was always good to me but now since i have lost my main account i am finally coming back to the game yet there is one issue since when did it turn into a such a huge gb storage game last time i played it took like six gb i think tho it is understandable with all the new places and characters my device is gonna explode please send help
1,still no controller support for this game even though on all other platforms it has controller support is absolute rubbish this is not a particularly enjoyable experience when played on touch screen which is a shame it seems like there is a good game here locked behind the worst control scheme ever
3,game can be a lot of fun lots of exploration and stuff to discover and experience great visuals gameplay and music but events are mostly copy pasted and fontaine didnt bring much needed qol updates either low levels of powercreep which helps if you do not want to spend a lot but i really do think the abyss evolution has been one of the worst systems i have ever seen in any game still a good experience i recommend people try
5,i do not play on mobile bit this game is really fun you get to explore the world and meet other players i have made some friends that way
1,old i love that the game even though is clearly marketed for profit still provides plenty of opportunities for freeplay so therere plenty of ways to get just as good of a gaming experience regardless of whether or not you wanna pay real money update wrong money grab after the first week of playing also cannot even log in anymore says network timeout two zero four after the dumb intelligent verification pop up
3,good game on the surface but when you dives deeper and play longer it is rotten to the core there is no point of building characters when you can six stars abyss the events are fomo traps you cannot play them once they are gone no endgame content the developer do not care about the playerbase the artifact farming is horrendous the resin system is very limiting and they are stingy play at your own risk do not expect anything especially qol update from them
4,it is okay if you wanna play it but be wary of the gacha it can suck you dry like a succubus also hoyoverse still gotta fix somethings like resin and the artifact system at high level it is just too boring to play the game as new characters need atleast decent artifacts to reach potential but the same are rng based and require resin to get which limits how much farming can be done for them so you reach a stage where you want to play new characters but it is too much work other than that it is ok
5,wonderful game big map characters and great storyline is amazing i like this game very much
5,ok so not only it has amazing graphics but amazing fighting scenes and you can play with your friends but there is a problem it is not a bug and it is not there fault but it takes up so much storage that on my ipad i cannot get it i have to use my phone you might think why not just delete stuff well i do one time i delete all my apps and i still couldnt get it i delete all my files pictures and videos but still nothing sadly but i can still play it so whatever but amazing
4,i would give this game five stars but this game is so amazing to be honest this game makes you burned out sometimes i farm for so long to get a character as soon as i lost fifty fifty my to wanderer i bought a one hundred dollar purshase and guess what five star this game makes you spend to much money and its stressful its really annoying that every time i lose fifty fifty my and i buy stuff its a five star right after it is like their asking you to spend money in order to get a five star this needs to stop
4,i absolutely love the game the visuals character designs gameplay all of it is great but one problem is that it takes over thirthy gb please find a way to fix this
5,exploration is challenging and fun characters are well designed and have their own interesting stories and personalities the special effects are amazing overall a very fun game i have been playing for a year and i really like this game however one thing that bothers me is the storage requirements overall i like it
4,amazing you can explore adventure or live a peaceful life i definitely recommend this game to all types of people the only problem is that sometimes it will not let me login so i have to try like ten times to login
2,play this game if you want to have to read an entire three hundred page ya novel in between every gameplay moment no skipping allowed
2,hi i just want everyone to know that we are having a hard time entering the game not because of our phone but because of the new update of fontaine and i am really missing out i hope it will get fixed
3,it was very wasting time for waiting verification file i am play in pc and mobile but in my pc so very wasting time in hours just for verifycation file to many update and but small update but in verifycation it is so loong for waiting
5,come to think of it overall genshin is a very great game but the downside is the in game rewards they give they do not give enough for players to freely clear certain in game content i would wish there was a grind able content for us to get to give way to free to play players
3,i burned out at least if you can just add skip button wich is simple for you to add it then i will stay you know not everyone will have that much time to hear those long conversation anymore as time pass except for some which mostly content creator oh and i am not even counting those puzzles which is a plus plus time to do
4,the game is gorgeous the map is expansive with beautiful variety the story is in depth th characters are imaginative and the world building is impressive it is just really boring the grinding is excessive and time sensitive the combat is incredibly repetitive story boss fights and special events not withstanding even though i have played this game for years i eventually decided to delete it after i noticed it was constantly putting me to sleep
3,i would have given five stats but the thing is that loading takes forever plus at the start of the game it is confusing please make the loading shorter everything else besides all of this it is a great game
4,perfect game and lovely co op but i wish we actually can switch servers but the same progress we had but make it like a while to download new resources to switch to a server and about the friends list one not sure but can we still have them in our list even if their different servers example my friend is europe server while i am asia server he can switch to europe to asia with the same progress he had with europe server also add an option of like want to make a new account
4,the game is extremely good i love playing it but there are some things i do not like resin the resin cap is sixty only and it takes eight minutes to get resin so it almost takes hours to recover fully you should increase the resin to two hundred and thirty or three hundred like you guys did it on honkai star rain one hundred eighty to two hundred eighty primogem every update we are gutting less primogem you should give us more opportunity to get more primogem besides daily commissions game contentafter reaching ar fifty it gets boring
5,i have been playing for over a year now and i love this game soo much highly recommend playing there are many quests events dailys exploring building characters and many more i am addicted hehe even though it needs a lot of storage
2,disappointment never disappear in terms of anniversary though a lot of story content but lack endgame content decent at best but never good enough
5,i love genshin it is such a good game great graphics and designs the characters are so nice as well i cannot wait to see what the game is like when it is finished
3,i wanted to download it but it will not load and it keeps saying i have insufficient space even though i deleted so many memories and photos videos and even apps
3,i cant play the game i suggest if your on a phone dont download it because i cannot play because the storage i deleted lots of apps just to not be able to play but i have seen it is a good game on the internet so there stars
5,it is the best game i have ever played try it once but you need a decent phone to run it if you have it then surely give it a try
5,its a great game i really like it but you have to have a lot of storage specially those who play genshin in mobile like me i guess i need to buy a new phone for genshin only but its good
1,it cannot be open e ery time just show free up space in my phone already lots of space but still it cannot open after downloading what nonsense
3,i have a problem with the game because if i download the files or something if you download the game it will tell me to log in and download it but i downloaded it but it tells me to login again and i have to download it again that is the only issue
3,one of the free great games to play that is available at playstore although i hope hoyoverse would listen to its players wishes because as the game progress it is getting more and more difficult it would be hard for us players who do not spend money on the game for various reasons so i do hope that it will be fair soon
4,great game however i feel that without support for kishi backbone and other attach to phone game controllers games such as this one is not at it is full mobile potential as the onscreen gamepad is not a sufficient alternative to buttons and joysticks
5,this game is awesome the open world game lets u do all kinds of stuff the character are well written and it runs smoothly in my phone the game optimisation is very well done but it is too large
4,it is a nice game from graphics to style play is nice but please do not swich genshin impact for funtap
5,best open world game even though a little tough to download for low quality devices as i have both emulator and phone i would say it is the best also the story and graphics are cool and smooth
5,amazing i love this game so much the first download the game gets is a bit annoying but it is worth it for the best gaming experience
5,honestly its the first game like it is kind that i ever played it takes a little grinding and hoarding skills lol but i trully appreciate it for what it is and the effort the developers put into it it seems like alot when your start late in the game it is okay go your own speed and enjoy the journey welcome to gi oh and yes the community overall cool can be a little weird at times
5,astonishing graphics beautiful regions for lots of exploration lore story quests and truly amazing battle it has it all the best game i have ever played it is more than worth it to download it
4,the game is very beautiful and everything in it is beautiful the characters and the maps but there is something i did not like which is why we cannot enter the game until after downloading five twenty five thousand mg and sometimes you must delete the game and download it again and download all of this again
5,one of the best games on playstore i am not only a mobile player but also a pc player so i know just how great this game is it is world building npc open world and all the other things are just top of the line and believe me you will not be finding this kind of mobile game with such high quality production in any other game on playstore the only con is that despite being a well rounded game it has some serious issue in optimization on mobile i mean my eighty eighteight is not able to keep up
5,i love this game personally my experience in this game is so awesome i love that you can buy new characters like getting characters i really like this game so keep it up
5,it is an amazing game i have been playing since like april ninth and i have stuck with it beautiful storyline awe inspiring graphics it is simply too good definitely recommend only minor is that you need a lot of space but it is worth it
5,yes this game is very amazing i have been playing since twenty twenty have not played any other game than genshin impact but please could you make the dainsleiff quest easier please i want to unlock inuzuma it would be nice if you did also please make higher levels get mail i have not been getting mail recently and the character i want is qiqi but i never got her and yes i will buy the weklin moon when i roll for qiqi may i please get her because she has been my dream character ever since i saw her thank you
5,unfortunately i have no words for this yes i am extremely glad that something new has appeared in the game but it takes up one hundred percent of my phone our paths diverge on this road i delete the game from my phone but i promise we will meet someday i had a great time playing this game many emotions many words but my travel ends here we will meet again and i will come with new emotions thank you it was a wonderful travel see you soon maybe
5,although it can cost a lot of your storage i think it is really worth it especially with the update with fontaine i think it is really worth it genshin is not fun at first but once you get to ar twenty to thirty it gets really fun getting to inazuma and the chasm is really fun too good luck with your wishing
5,my experience has been great so far just started playing a week ago and i am already addicted i would suggest especially because it is an easy game to play
5,really addictingly fun game no seriously literally be careful of the gacha plays great on mobile though bows are awkward
5,fontaine climax was simply amazing looking forward for the continuation of the main story in natlan
3,good day i would like to raise a concern regarding a top up purchase issue when i attempt to top up it tells me to top up using the device used to register the account this is a major issue because i barely have access to that device now also i fail to realize why the game is requiring me to do that and not just let me top up with my current device please fix this i also would like to get your reply on this please thank you
5,such a fun and detailed game been playing it for a while now the graphics are amazing same with the designs the only current issue i have is that it keeps crashing on my gaming laptop
5,the game is a goat for anime watchers it is a treat for me the best open world story for both pc and phones as a player whos been playing it since the only thing i want at this point story and archon quest rerun to freshen up our memories and older player will even invest more time in the game hoyo do not even have to give rewards just story reruns
4,the game itself is great beautiful scenenery great artstyle amazing char and story as long as you consider it as a single player game for an online game this game is trash barely any pve and no pvp content which is fine by me for the pvp part and most of all the devs are not interested in your opinion or feedback they just do what they deem you want or need
4,i have spent two years of my life in this game and it is sadly getting boring i am ar fifty five now finished the latest archon quest and the other side quests except the cleansing sakura quest heck i am not doing it i just ask three things one consider increasing the resin cap like star rail two make more end game content and three make the limited weapons obtainable via paimons bargains gosh i need albedos weapon the time he is getting a rerun
5,i love the storyline hoyoverse has given us through this game there is a lot of grinding to be done which is annoying as it relies on sheer luck but apart from that the immersive experience provided to the story is amazing
5,i am never the type to play open world games in gacha types of games but this got me hooked compelling story flashy effects immaculate music and the characters that feels so alive but out of all of them i say it is the graphics that is the most beautiful over all great game
4,although my luck is pretty bad and never won the fiftys free to play btw reason of four stars this game is fantastic it is addictive not sure if that is good it helps you escape from reality it gives you friends that will never betray you it is music sends you to the land of fantasies it is characters are gorgeous their voice acting is superb the story is insane the world to explore is fun and huge it makes your phone a very good hand roaster it fills your storage to the brim but most of all must play game
3,it is is a good and an awe game but it is conditions for installment is very high it is around five gb and it can increase in future its lag in low end but mine is six gb ram and one hundred twenty eight gb storage it is avery laag
4,i really love this game but it always take so much storage every update is nice and all but really pls make like that less storage is taken because i like this game some much i bearly have app so pls
4,overall it is a great game and the graphics are amazing but there is problem that whenever i open genshin on my tablet it crashes and it have not worked for about months pls fix this problem
5,this game is awesome graphics are awesome it may take space and time but it is worth the wait
1,please make the artifact system like in honkai star rail atleast let us choose the main stat i am always getting best substat with worst main stat
1,i love the game but so many flaws are not easy to overlook they powercreep characters as if people getting good characters would hurt their business will not give voice over for important stories and the stories contain names i cannot pronounce or remember so cannot care there are more annoying issues like these recently fontaine update came and they changed their system requirements what about the people who started playing before cz they found a game that ran in their pc and now it does not
5,this game if freaking awesome it is on another level of mobile games i am playing about forty days and i am feeling goooood thanks for updates and the beauty of tayvat
2,great game but the amount of storage space this requires is insane do you want only playstation and pc users to play because i have cleared my phone and my tablet of everything that i can and i still cannot even begin to download it and a lot of what other people i know have said they have the same problem yall need to fix this seriously
5,great game with a lot of different types of characters how do yall even know how to design characters in a way that we all love ahhhhhhhhhhhh
3,i personally adore thisbgame i love it love the characters the open world game experience but the game just takes up too much storage and with each new update my phone just cant keep up with all the new places to explore i have been waiting for the newest region to experience and its taking too much space i eould love to continue my travels in this game but just cant keep up with the new content
5,i do not even know how to express how amazing this game is i just love it the story and animations are really amazing
3,i have been playing this game for more then years now but just today the app was crashing whenever i try to open it on my device i recently bought a new device and have been playing on this for two months now but i faces this problem just today please look into this i love this game alot and this is the only game i reside in
2,the game itself is good and all but the only issue is it is space size i cannot really play in my android anymore i have two gb free space but to update three hundred mb i have to free up more space and in pc the size is already one hundred gb what is this they should add past quest resources deletion in pc too and fix these android problems
5,this game is an open world game wich is one of the types of games i love another thing is that the graphics and design and concept of this game is just awsome animations are also awsome the game is very fun to play as it also haves side missions wich makes the game give more activities the game has a really awsome combat system and details of the combat system overall i recomend playing this when you need an open world game
4,edit twenty seven gb now after four point zero update think before installing really nice game and graphics it does take significant amount of time initially but later stages gets really slow and you actually need to wait for game update to play more there is tons of stuff to explore but gets monotonous after some time it was one point five month for me update how big this game is going to be it is already more than twenty gb now and cache will be more tired of this
2,i genuinely would play this game but until you guys allow my controller to even be an option im not going to especially when my controller lets me play minecraft on my phone diablo immortals on my phone i can play multiple games that do not even require a controller on my phone i can use my controller for my phone itself without a game in use if all of those things are clearly capable being done it is clearly capable of you genshin impact being able to let me use my controller please fix
4,so i never got into the hype about genshin at release only decided to try it after playing star rail and i get it game is beautiful and enormous and borrows heavily from breath of the wild i find the action combat not entirely suitable for mobile but besides that everything else about the game is remarkably well done
5,one of the best available mobile games massive open world area that gets expanded constantly a good story and amazing music updates are constant coming in around every one point five months as well the gacha system is also fair and you can one hundred percent free to play the entire game without having any problems
4,i really like it maybe make it easier to get primo gems but overall is a great play it is addicting send help
1,tos not loading i am using a laptop this works perfectly fine on my phone except my phone is broken and i cannot get the game to load past the login screen because when i try to load the tos they do not load i get a blank screen no matter how long i leave it to load i really wish that you could just check the box instead of going to the bottom of the tos like come on we all know no one reads those things anyways this makes this game literally unplayable for people like me makes me sad
4,i like this game so much but there is a bug where the damage ang elemental reaction do not show so pls fix thisbtw i am in mobileand please the reduce storage consumption as much as possible thank you
5,the game is really good its one of my main games so i suggest to play this game its kinda boaring cuz of the conversations but it stills good like perfect game for solving mystery exploring doing quests upgrading characters etc so its perfect which fits anything i am just asking the devs to add like skipping conversations and ty for ur time which u wasted for reading this d
5,i love genshin impact the whole plot is great the music and visuals are amazing as well not only that the characters within the game have their own unique story and style the different regions that you can visit throughout the story are so interesting to explore the visuals on phone are not the best but other than that i would like to say it is a really good game that has a couple of flaws i would recommend playing one hundred percent
5,amazing game ever since i have heard about this game i was really interested in trying it for myself to see the hype i definitely do not regret it it is for me the best action role playing game i have ever played yes it requires lots of storage but it has a very beautiful and interesting storyline even the characters have stories of their own just the concept itself is worth all the hype i am obsessed with this game and would give it ten stars if possible
1,the game really need a skip button at least for the side quests and and world quest because is a player is not interested in reading dialogue then what is the point of not letting them to skip the dialogue and waste their time on clicking the screenjust what is the difference of not reading the dialogue and skipping the dialogue
5,genshin impact is seriously amazing i cannot get enough of its stunning open world the awesome storyline and the wide range of characters the graphics are so detailed and exploring teyvat feels like an adventure in itself the combat system is super fun and there is always something new happening with the updates and events huge props to the developers for making a game that is not just addictive but keeps evolving it is my go to game and i cannot thank them enough
5,have a wonderful story and also characters u might be owned embark a new journey of open world
5,the graphics and art style is absolutely amazing story is interesting and fun and character design is gorgeous overall i recommend genshin impact to everyone but i do recommend playing on pc or laptop rather than on phone
5,i have issues logging in edit it is okay now my brother tinkered with the device and removed all permissions and etc i made it work again
2,pls allow to change server with data and progress i face issues with ping on eu cannot play with friends and all pls change this it would help a lot or else i have no reason to play the game i have to quit otherwise
2,its an amazing game very fun however i came accross a bug or glitch where i was exploring in fontaine but i randomly got kicked while exploring an underwater cave now i cant log into my main account and it certainly is not a storage problem or phone problem because i can use my other accounts just fine please fix this bug i want to use my main account
5,i have always been hesitant to play this game even though i have wanted to for a long time now that i have a new phone with a butt load of storage i am finally able to play and i regret not downloading it sooner
5,this is a great game with one of the best graphics and stories i have seen and one of my favorite parts of this game go for the characters their designs and different abilities i would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of anime manga and rpg games
5,based on my experience genshin overall is a pretty spectacular game it has an optimized ui beginner friendly gameplay one of the most astonishing game graphics and last but not the least an intriguing story plot though it is a gacha game you cannot deny the fact that genshin is more than just your plain old gacha game where you just pull wish for characters weapons non stop
5,hi hoyo gotta love this game when it first came out i totally misjudged it and thought it was a stupid game i mean i wasted a whole year hating on it until the tiktok algorithm decided to recommend some genshin videos to me i finally gave in and after playing it for quite the while all i have to say to the newcomers is that save your sanity because after getting gambling addictions you will not have any of it left
1,this is awful game i have many negatives this game why waste primogems choice five star character or weapon i suggest only five star character and this delete is weapon game please fix why each eighty primogems for choice five star character or weapon waste primogems i do not like this is game i am quit this is game and other problems very slow run for gas climbing exp adventure full heal for characters swimming playing cards jump up fly too many chests and others please fix
4,there are a lot of mechanics behind all the actions you can take in this game if you start just focusing on what seems important you will have fun
3,the app keeps crashing when i try to run it usually while loading sometimes right after starting the game sometimes i have to try five six times before i can actually get into the game
4,instead of spendings three hundred dollars and one thousand hours in this game you know what i could have done trying to get some girls and undepress myself but instead i chose big anime booba and more knowledge on how this game works then knowledge about my own family eight over ten would recommend to everyone who likes mildly dark fantasy stories surprisingly deep combat and a beautiful world to explore the puzzles might mess you up if you are not smarter than a seven grader
4,i loveeee this game i have not missed a single day but the thing that bothers me is the storage that it takes i deleted so many apps to play it but it is still an amazing game
5,cannot stop playing such a good game i wish they would add romance and marriage as a suggestion to any npc
5,this game is super fan and there will all ways have event but the promogems they give is super cheap but sometimes have best reward geshin impact make me learn about english and the story gives you more knowledge like never give up or fighting is the best option if you need to i all ways remember my first play this game that i really super because this is the first time i play rpg in my phone so this game make me happy and you can find new friends
1,good game but do not expect anything from the dev when it comes to rewards you will regret it the dev seems to ignore player requests even simple ones like updating the resin system you can play while being free to play if you are lucky or else it is pay to win
2,played this game on my other phone since twenty twenty i hate the lzeroli bait and the game is just overwhelming and money hungry it is fun but there is too much to do that you mentally become tired and stressed it is not like everyone that plays this game does not have a life and can do multiple quests for hours non stop also this game has its issues on its own and the fan base is even worse most of the adult characters look a lot like teens which is horrible and disgusting
2,well at first everything is fine i had so much fun playing the game untill i unlocked a teleport in fontaine the next day i stuck at the elements loading screen and when it reached the geo element my phone froze and everything start to lagging and the phone need to force stop i thought it was my internet connection but it was not so i deleted the game and install it back and the problem still there so i only rate it out of five but if this problem fix i am gladly to give this game a five out of five
5,one of the best free to play game which is truly cross platform and that has a really good story detailed characters impressive controls great audio and visuals of course there are bugs and glitches with any new update but they get resolved sooner or later also the game is unforgiving on low to mid tier spec phones edit the games still the same for me more or less but seriously needs optimization with increasing updates lags and stutters are awfully annoying
5,great game i have not gotten to far into it but i hope the gig download and now another ten gig is worth the drain on my memory awesome game and graphics just wish i had found it sooner also if this newest update does not do it please fix the crash problem
5,i love it it is the only game i stick to and can never be replaced but the storage is kinda a problem
1,this game is super not beginner friendly you wont have the materials to build the characters on the banner you pulled for nowadays all the banners are for late game players who are on the latest map ex the banners are fontaine characters but you started at mondstadt you wont have access to the necessary materials until you get to the fontaine map it will take months to reach that map
1,the game is good has great story and potential but hoyoverse does not give it much importance they just see it as a cash cow for their other games you can easily see it in the treatment it recieves compared to the rewards in honkai star rail they refuse to acknowledge this games shortcomings and instead improve things in their other games i have never seen such blatant discrimination from a game company trash
5,amazing game awesome graphics and fabulous soundtracks the character designs are super likeable and lovely as well the only issue i face is regarding ping which is generally two hundred for me i play asia i wish hoyoverse resolves this
5,excellent all around graphics are smooth the world is massive the characters are numerous each have different abilities and i like that lots of content to explore and complete
5,considering the game is free the devs have put so much work in it there are some flaws like no end game content bad rng for the gacha artifacts and rare update on quality of life in game overall its a great game the amount of space its required is getting bigger and bigger as expected but this is getting ridiculously huge for mobile devices
5,fast customer support and problem resolution within four hours i am glad this app made my day and its graphics are amazing thanks genshin impact
5,chaptor four of the archon quest is the best video game story i have played this year truly a masterpiece
4,this game is amazing i love it so much the characters designs are incredible and the archon quests are very enjoyable too my only problem is that it takes too much storage i litrealy deleted every game on my phone but it is still saying i need to make more space i do not know what to do anymore
3,i love the game been playing since twenty twenty one plus stories graphics are amazing but every update seems to grow larger and larger leaving my phone with no space at all i have enough space to update yet it says i do not i cleared my entire device to just update this game nothing happens which is a disappointment
1,add controller support and key bindings for android users too we also love this game and use controllers too do not do discrimination between ios and android users thanks
5,it is a very good game with great quality and all the story quest and archon quest are also great the designs are very nice some characters are way too revealing but it is fine they look fine and all that is all keep it up hoyoverse
4,just uninstall it and reinstall the game and is good love the game that is why i get annoyed if it is not work smoothly
5,new fontaine archon quest is really amazing the storytelling in fontaine insanely good open world exploration superb this is the best update so far
5,been playin this game since the beginning and this never fails to amuse me every update gives me a lot of fun gameplay and exciting rewards the characters unique perks and compositions makes it a lot more fun the gacha systems quite annoying the chances of you getting your desired character weapon is low if your free to play but that is expected in every gacha i will give a five star regardless so looking forward for more contents xiaooo
4,fun solid game held back only by needing to accommodate mobile users and the lack of any challenging permanent combat modes other than spiral abyss mostly meaningless fetch quests also get old fast
4,wish we could get more primos in the grave period of time between regions coming out like you have explored all of fountaine and you are waiting for the next region but it is good good game
5,this world is so awesome and i love this open world exploring and story line etc i do not know how to tell but i love so much
3,the game is amazing really it has breathtaking graphics the music is top notch and the characters are spot in my problem is that my genshin does not have any grass damage text and ice and some of the characters faces does not have any lighting in it actually this really bothers me slightly but please hoyo can you fix this
5,honestly while this game does have it is issues as does the company the actual playthrough and storyline is really good it is most everything you could want from an open world rpg i love the different characters and their personalities and stories not dori but i would like to see some better rep on skin tone but that is about it the plot is great and co op is very fun i have met alot of my best friends through genshin as sad as that is definatly a good play though nine over ten recomend
4,it is a great game just does not fit in my phones storage space anymore since the four update
1,it takes one hundred years to complete all the quests because you cannot skip the bullshi dialogue pay money to my precious time
1,it is spending your money on other endeavours and it shows does not want to pay it is english vas stories drone on with no crescendo and some areas are mechanically busted players are hostile toward the company the game and eachother they could remedy this by rewarding players so new bad kids are not so bad or by revamping a tired money mill of a gatcha system that permeates all aspects of the game with trash items weapons and artifacts they will not fix these problems
1,i love the game but when came back after a few months i got a notification saying please make sure you have enough storage something like that but i have eight gb gb i do not understand how i do not have enough storage too play this game i do not know why i uninstalled everything on my phone launched the game and still no storage even u installing and reinstalling the game it will not work so please if you can fix this that would be great
4,great game but controls are a bit fiddly probably my fat fingers very engaging world and characters with plenty to do just be prepared for the massive download and long installation several hours before you get stuck in
5,i love this game ever since i have downloaded it i uninstall other games that i do not olay as often as this game i hate myself sometimes when i finish all the quests and stories and now i have nothing to do but wait for the events and new regions as well as it is new quests and stories
5,love the game so so so much i have one thing i would like added and that is a feature where you can trade characters for other characters i would trade my c keqing for anything rn the service is also amazing i lost my account back in september and they kept replying to my emails quickly i got my account back within at most months
4,it is a great game and i thoroughly enjoy playing it and exploring the free roam however i am facing an issue where i cannot download the update even though i have more than enough space on my phone please fix this problem as i will not be able to play the game otherwise
5,i have been playing this for the last year and it is the bestt except the they are not doing much for the game upgrade
5,very fun i love exploring and battling enemys the game is very unique and i love it
5,it is super fun and long i really like these type of games but for some phones graphics are too extensive
5,fontaine is very enjoyable and looking to the four update so far i really love the game and the gacha i should accept that i am not lucky as always ninety fps and one hundred twenty fps for smoother gameplay and for the resin atleast make a feature that you can still gain resin even if the daily resin cap is full that is all and keep up i love the game so yea
2,the third anniversary reward of genshin impact is not satisfactory at least for us the feature chooses five stars in the standard banner or it is better to add daily resin like the honkai star rail game will not it
1,this game ruined me i hate everything in this game the rates the missions the pity system the artifacts i need that autoclear feature in this game the powercreep is horrendous the fact you cant skip the story that green grassoculus thingy that took me four hours the optimization the characters except noelle she with my gang and finally no primogems outta five go play battle cats an ar fifty six
4,the game was absolutely awesome there is always new events and can get lots of character but i suggest that weapon can be downgrade to get the materials for upgrading it is really hard these days that upgrading character also changing weapon
1,the game does not have much content now and you can burn throught the quests fast and it will then become a boring game cause all that is left to do are dailies which are repetitive
1,how much space does this game require i have a sixty four gb phone with forty percent space free and i keep getting an insufficient space message instead of it doenloading in game resources game never gets past login screen then insufficient space message update august seventeen twenty twenty three sorry but your response is usless obviously it requires more space i asked specifically how much and your response is make sure you have sufficient storage what a non answer waste of time
3,the recent update of fontaine has been really good but i encountered some recent problems in the game were i was doing a quest in fontaine my game suddenly crushed and even though i already re download all the files i still couldnt log in my account i have been playing this game since release and this was the very first time it happened to me please fix it hoyoverse my phone has been handling this game for years
4,i really love this game i am almost years but now i cannot play it since the problem is the small storage space i am still suffering with my gb phone and i suggest to give us atleast an option of to delte past resources in the starting screen
4,fun smooth creative gameplay with great characters the only downside is i am now addicted to gambling
4,i do not know why but game is not loading and it is full black and it is hang and there are so many buildings invincible it is not loading in the new region
5,this game is awesome i remember playing sword of chaos at twelve yrs old when i first heard of this game i thought it would be just like that game but it is even more amplified with such beautiful and aweing landscapes each character is so unique you fall in love with them and go for them such an obsessive lore you want to dive into etc there is many things to love about this game i one hundred recommend thanks mihoyo ❣
5,thanks for taking away my boredom people who are thinking of downloading twenty gb game on your phone one advice just download it u will not regret explore the magical world the characters the lore the world exploration the graphics the music etc all make this game a top notch hats off to the developers for developing such a game
3,would have given a higher rating if it did not take up so much storage it is supposed to be a mobile game yet it requires so much i have not been able to play due to how much storage each update takes up and we have not even finished half of the game yet quite disappointing since i have been playing since four and would love to keep playing but i cannot update or launch it
4,i love to play this app on playstation but i cannot use it on my tablet even though i have the data to play this game but i love this game either way its really fun and helps pass the time
3,i really love this game only downside is its very expensive like spending one hundred does not give you any guarantee for pulling characters unless you already build pity and the events are not new player friendly as a beginner im missing out a lot of events because the quest where can we get primos is only available on new contents
5,everything is perfect like fr i loved fontaine so much that i one hundred percent area in my alt already my main acc is focused on the story not exploring the music and everything is clearly making me addicted to genshin once again keep expanding fontaine and i might get a new phone lol sixty four gb surviver here still have about ten gb left thank you hyv you have done a great job making me addicted to all your game
5,in depth lore six gig of mobile gaming data fast paced combat large world enjoyment to grinding so much free content not pay to play buying ingame for things you want to buy not have to large community base only faults are in game messaging early on but you have to play and level to unlock feature overall a fantastic game i have only scratched the surface and been playing weeks cannot wait to join rest of community co op mode when leveled character update review soon
2,i really love this game so fun and addicted i love everything about it this game is worth five stars but i have to give stars for now after downloading version the game keep crashing it suddenly exit and i have to start again its pretty annoying when im in a quest in fontaine it will crashed in a middle of video play so i have to do it again i cant finish if it keep crashing please fix it and i will edit my review and rate it five stars thank you
4,the game is just epic its so fun to play but the only two reasons i gave four stars is sometimes the puzzles get too difficult for players the graphics are cool but for a mobile player well they need to compromise on the graphics and resolution bcz the phone just gets overheated in five mins
1,this game so bad they do the adds for nothing whats so fun about this trash infinite load crashing game horrible i would give this a zero star if could
5,the best open world adventure game i have ever played the puzzles and treasure hunting are really awesome i really enjoy playing with friends exploring different regions and fighting bosses
4,love this game but i got my phone restored and i had to reinstall it and takes too long to download edit i still have not reinstalled it and its taking so long so i just do do it my friend wants me to install it and she keeps bugging me so i will try to leave it overnight also this game is really entrataining but some dailys are just hard and i raged and broke my phoneedit again i installed it and i am playing it four seven its addicting and i love it again
5,overall the games good and the characters are pretty fun to play too there are also event though i would like to say that maybe it is me that is too fast but everytime after i finish an event it feels like there is nothing left to do except doing commissions and domains everyday edit albedo tcg in pls edit thank you for hearing me out i love you hyv
5,very good game story is good music is good and character design are nice
4,it is amazing game but the gifts in this game are bad i hope you can give us better rewards and make us get thirty wishes its better than twenty
5,i love playing genshin impact specially because i make a lot of friends and they all want to help each other with their problem no so far i did not encounter some toxic people that is why i love playing this
4,it is a great game but everytime the hoyoverse sign disappears my game crashes can you please fix this problem ⁠╥⁠﹏⁠╥⁠
1,so here we are again im still rating star because the recent quest is so boring and a whooping eight hours plus quest why cant you just put some skip for people that does not have time to do you are quests
5,my brother and i have been playing this game since it came out and we love it there have been so many good characters and events throughout this game the storyline and character plots have not only been fun but exhilarating how it feels to play this game can not be put into words it is just a feeling that i get from playing the game there are challenging sections that make it an even more in depth experience playing genshin impact thank you for creating such an amazing gaming experience
5,genshin impact is one of the best games i have ever played it opens with action and holds your attention allowing you to spend hours simply exploring the map with fascinating new characters and fun events genshin is a must have for any mobile gamer this game i had an intriguing story leaving you hooked within an hour however there is no oceania server for us aussies and kiwis and it takes up so much space on your device mine currently has nine gigabytes occupied by genshin install this
5,best game it have everything like adventure vast open world to explore variety of characters many biomes good story line graphics many playable characters in t can make you to feel your own anime story that every anime watchers always wanted
5,probably one of the best rpgs i have played in a long time i love how they all have different kinds of magic attacks
5,i really love this game its graphics are uncomperable and it is story plot is mesmerizing the thrill to enjoying the game and wondering it is true plot history thank you for creating this game until next time
2,the dialogue in this game is too frequent and way too long it is also frustrating as you cannot skip dialogues and cinematics please add an option to skip both dialogues and cinematics
4,even if it is not an mmo game it is still awesome though it is graphics in phones are not upto the mark but i am still loving the game and it is story
3,this games really good good story characters details and more the controls are simple too but the events and mechanics keep being the same and i am slowly burning out
5,it is a really fun game and the details and the design of the characters just wow and the quests
1,frustrating at best not great at being a legit gacha yet not stand alone enough remove micro transactions its a trap its a huge download the cutscenes are choppy eats phone battery like roasted marshmallows maybe you can have better experience on pc or console expect to waste years of life culminating one or more accounts just to attempt to acquire but not actually get the character you want
5,the graphics are amazing and the story line is insane it is really fun and it is an online game too
5,i like how we can get characters by doing quests how we can get new weapons and all the stuff we can do to get our characters stronger and make wishes
5,i love this game for pretty much everything is has to offer except the grass i can not use and fire pyro moves on grass or the character i use diluc currently will take more damage from burning themselves on the grass than from what i am actually fighting which is ridiculous to me would rate five stars if i were not taking one hundred damage per second and losing one thousand to two thousand hp per what are supposed to be simple overworld fights i know this has already been nerfed once but still wl five
4,genshin impact is a good game at the start if you enjoy a good story along with decent awards it is really so so but late game is so horrible some people who max out everything complain about the free to play primogen grind which is outrageous but unfortunately there are limited time events we can do for primos and future map exploration so if you want to start the game please keep in mind that it is not really free to play friendly if you do not like grinding the gameplay and characters are okay tbh
5,no words i just love genshin it is amazing the characters the lore the whole game in general is perfection
3,i have heard such good things about this game yet after deleting half my photos and apps i cannot play it due to insufficient storage space if i had one suggestion please lower the amount of storage required i cannot write a review about the gameplay because i cannot play
2,this game is absolutely fantastic but the version is too much for my phone redmi note five and i cannot play it because it shows insufficient storage and it is seriously annoying no matter how much i delete it says the same thing insufficient storage ill give it five star once i can play it
5,fun game interesting characters love the game graphics are okay new region fontaine keeps crashing on pc but its fine on mobile so
4,amazing game just that it does cause ur phone to crash but i guess it depends on your phone love this game would give it four five stars if i could
3,oct eleven twenty twenty first time i joined now here i am ar sixty having to hit hard pity every time as a free to play im getting sick of how awful the pity system is becoming for the free to play pls improve it like star rail
2,please fix the ping issue after fontaine update the asia server ping always between four hundred fifty to five hundred sixty threems the delay was too much cannot get good game experience since can explore under sea world let alone challenge the abyss do not get me wrong fontaine was a good update since the sumeru issue hence please fix the high ping problem asap as i only have free time to play during night time
4,dear mihoyo please respond although the gameplay is amazing there are several issues in game which many people complain about we do not really feel too attached to the characters they do not give facial expressions unlike star rail the kits seem repetitive like keqing and alhaitam being almost obvious i am sure new types of kits will help a lot i would like to know when the cloud storage app will be available world wide i will change my reviews after i get a response thank you
4,the game is nice the graphics are crack but the disappointing thing is the anniversary rewards there were no major eventful things they only gave us twenty wishes not anything else so that is very disappointing for free to play people
3,if you are expecting rewards do not play it the characters are good and the gameplay is fun but the devs are so obviously greedy they barely give anything for their anniversary and this is made worse by the ridiculous gacha system not to mention the game frequently develops bugs that they are slow in patching there was an incident where a hacker was able to delete people out of their game that terrified loads of players that they took far too long to patch
1,not sure there are no significant improvement from this game after years the qol the rewards the events etc totally meh
5,update it is been some time now since i started this game and i still love it however the only thing i hate the most is there garcha system i do not mind paying money to get what i want or at least try to however if you draw an extra and already have it maxed out you do not get your spin your points or currency of anykind it just disappears that is not how you treat your player base yet another thing to top it off the system does not offer a character choose option at least offer one a month
1,when i put my facebook account it is not working and when i put my twitter account it is not working i do not know why it is not working so please creator fix the problem right away because i want to play it
3,i like the game very much it is very fun and enjoyable but there is a quest where you have to find runes with an aranara and i cannot complete it because i pressed the runes in the wrong order can you please fix that
4,it is a good game overall and the new updates quality is breathtaking but i must say it is still a bit buggy
5,this is the most fun role play game i have ever played it has a lot of lovely and cute characters and it also has an interesting storyline which made me play this game i wonder when will lumine and aether will be reunited again i am waiting for it as for the closing i really enjoy this game and i suppose i love this game because my characters stayed with me more than the actual people that i have
5,really great game i think the graphics play style story is all very good even has an option for multiplayer so it is a really good game in general highly recommend for people who want a fun role playing game
5,started to play the game for quite some time and started loving it from the character design to story lore and events the game has a lot to offer its jam packed on what you look for an open world game
4,a free to play game an open world stunning graphics structures and places awesome characters and cool mechanics amazing archon and story quests i really enjoy this game the only problem is that you got lesser to do when you are already on late game ar fifty five and above however as the game storage gets higher i cannot help it i already deleted my past game resources but still ending up with high storage in mobile i hope this can be addressed somehow
4,good game fun game a lot to do on the game but it takes up to much space keep wanting me to update but does not free up not used space so not enough space to keep playing the game
5,the best experience yet but is not there any way to reduce the soze of this game it is a bit concerning as it occupies around seven gb of storage
4,could you please change it so if one already had the app can automatically sign in and begin to play if reinstalled please
3,okay updating my a review a little bit played the game a little bit i still think it is a great game i have tried to change the graphics but i do not believe high graphics are supported on android devices and when i try to turn them up my game was buggy laggy and unresponsive
4,the most beautiful game i will ever find unfortunately i will give it a four stars because of the storage it is so big it crashes sometimes please make the data storage low so that people can play without any problems of storage
5,overall review the best free to play game period awesome story great combat mechanics exploration puzzles and last but not least husbandos and waifus sim p s lookout for the massive file size review fontaine is great but it is a real shame we cannot swim underwater in other regions
4,by far one of the best mmorpg that you can play on multiple platforms my only qualm is i wish there was an auto pick up items option would make it easier to collect items on mobile for sure
1,its been a while but please make the resin cap higher or reduce resin restoration and if please improve the weapon banner
5,lots of fun and i love the story and art design the only thing that gets a bit annoying is the lag on mobile and the amount of storage it takes up but other than that it is an amazing game
3,its a star because i used to play genshin and everything was running smoothly and everything was d but now it laggy and glitcthy and the trees are d ive also tried reinstalling it and closing it out to reopen it but nothing seems to work so this is my last resort something else i need to add on is i tried to create a new password for an account that got signed out and it said couldnt connect try again even though i had wifi so im just very confused at this point
3,it is a fantastic game the storyline and the open world adventure is amazing the only problem i have is whenever it has an update to install through the playstore like version three point zero for example the update never downloads first try there is always a problem
5,the game is very great i would highly recommend playing it because the story is great and the graphics are ok but honestly it is free
5,the game is awsome but guys find a solution the storage space it takes is way too much
3,i love this game alot but for some reason it keeps kicking me off the game so i do not get away i have enough storage for the game and do not want to delete it
2,i mean i like the game but it is too much it added like shaders physics and wasted a lot of storage
5,the gameplay is amazing however the size of the downloads is getting to be a massive drag on mobile space and ram the best option this game would need is to store the majority of the game on servers and have only the basic resources need to run the game on mobile
5,i love this game it has a lot of challenges and the characters are so super cool too i love the graphics
5,edit it is been almost a year now since i have started playing and the only problem i encountered is the size of the game which goes up by to four gb almost evey month do not get me wrong the updates never disappoint they always bring exiting content and gamemodes which are very enjoyable but it is hard keeping up if you have a low end phone i suggest using mid range phones to avoid any inconvenience
5,the graphics are really good controls respond well and the storyline and characters are my new obsession however when downloading it you must have a good amount of storage cause it is really big but all in all it is a good another suggestion is to add a beginners manual for new players i had to ask my friends how to achieve certain things edit if not for the sheer size it has it will not be so hard to download
5,i loved playing it in the very beginning so much to do so many stories to be told so many photos to take but since i started around launch there is not much for me to do anymore the only things i look forward to are new areas events are recycled and repetitive new story comes once a year with the new areas and then you wait months for something anything new to come overall it is still an amazing game the devs put so much work into it and new players can look forward to binge playing it
4,the game is so much fun almost perfectly but my problem is it is so hard to get a five star characters i hope you might like to adjust the rate
5,its so nice to play and i love this game so much and this game never be forgotten and this game is part of our heart now because it can take off your problem sometimes when your angry
3,so its been almost years and i gotta say they have improved some things the game has gotten more content and more interesting characters sadly they still seem to be holding back on so many potential changes for instance artifact layouts increasing the resin cap better artifact rng etc but for now at least we can enjoy the new region just wished mihoyo would stop holding back on those qol updates man
4,perfect but it needs tons of space to play on and it took up a lot of gb so i had to delete it
5,i really loved the game but only one thing that i did not like is that when i complete everything i have no quests left and i do not know what to do thanks cookie
3,good characters scenery voice actors pretty beautiful music combat gameplay bad the most unfair gacha system i have ever played in my whole life absolutely loathe it so hard to earn enough primogems there is too much to put here
3,the games great overall but i always exit the game when i keep on playing i even need to restart the ones you go on partys although i do think it is my storage or my wifi but they are all good it is just the game so please fix this
5,i loved this game through and through extremely underrated people like saying how bad it is but theyve never played it
3,the game is good overall but the wishing system is rigged it said a five star character in ninety draws or on your ninetyth draw but instead i got a five star item so now i only have four stars i want a five star character but it is rigged
4,its a very good game and once you reach level six you can play with others the graphics are beautiful you cannot play without wifi and takes alot of storage otherwise its a very good game
2,really after updating to four only needs like four gb on my phone after download it i left it for a second and update four eight gb hoyoverse you are truly scammers
4,good game but a bit misleading on the games storage it is over over twenty gb in size when downloaded
5,i have given them five star since twenty twenty one and i never thought of changing the customer service is very very good they always reply on my questions within a day and clear the misunderstanding right away heads up to those people who works on their customer service thank you so much
5,love it the voice lines are perfect the art style is amazing everything is so beautiful the story is very suspenseful
4,this game is great but if its going to download it keeps telling me i dont have enough storage when i do and i deleted twenty plus gb but still wont work pls help
5,genshin was very fun i had fun playing it the quality was good not much lags definitely would recommend people to play this
5,the game deserves five hovoverse i did not think it is so good the controls are easy and as a phone player i thought it would crash ur more high quality then a game i have and it lags more but i am a free play so no money from me sorry hovoverse ok defintally i suggest but u need to be patient bc it takes lots of time to download tho
1,this game sucks because it would let continue through the downland resources because i do not have enough space even tho i have twenty gb of storage free so tell why this thing will not work
5,super good game and updates not to mention like ninety nine of the players are super friendly and will help you with everything you need at a low ar i have spent so much time in fontaine the region is just amazing so many underwater puzzles and things to do
2,seemingly a good game but the fact you do not have controller support on android after so many years tells me you do not want people to play your game it exists on pc and ios to my understanding and there is even a menu to select input type but for whatever reason you refuse to add it in game size is far too bloated for something you have to play on touchscreen just not worth keeping
3,good game but whenever u try to use the europe server my screen goes black the turns off having to start all over is not thrilling as one day the server worded for me then suddenly did not please help me out here
1,genshin impact crashes every time i try to play on my chromebook at about five when compiling the shaders
5,very fun tragic sad and hard but an amazing game probably the best open world game you can do multiple mission quest cook build your character give your characters weapons and artifacts fight travel and discover new things
5,love the game beautiful graphics love the charachter designs but it takes up so much room on my phons i wish there was a fix for that
5,it is been a year since i play this game i even brought a new phone so i can play more smoothly everyone is hating on you now but i prefer to look on the brighter side thank you for this wonderful year and thank you for giving me an unforgettable memory i still love this game and i am still supporting your games since twenty seventeen let the world know how talented you all in making games i am here to support you guys about the anniversary rewards i have no comments but it can be improve
4,it is a very well planned lore exploration type game problem is takes way like way too much space on mobile unless you have two hundred sixty gb or five hundred gb there is no way you will be able to have this game before it is finished
1,needs optimization and character balance early characters are almost useless in newer content newer characters need materials from newest bosses even if that character is from the very first region no skip button scene is too long and without akip button is pain
1,basically unable to pass ar ascension after updated to nov eighteenth twenty twenty three version image collide happens i need a solution to it
5,it is a fun game like botw but honestly it is grind heavy but taking your time is the games way of doing things happy anniversary genshin
5,best rpg mobile adventure game ever i love the graphics and the storyline is the best cannot stop playing
5,can you improve the artifact farming system because this thing makes many player losing interest playing if i say so my self i am one of those
2,after this recent fiasco i cannot support this game anymore tons of unfixed bugs that hinder the player while fun glitches are fixed immediatly their solution censor everything from chat to profile message and their mods on all websites and discord are working overtime there is also the fact that artifact rng is fixed i had fun with this game but the more you play it the more you realise how many things are wrong with it droping to since its rd year of dissapointment for anniversary
5,only don t like the long dialogues in game but the game is a masterpiece in visuals and action and gamplay
5,in itself the game is really good but it takes too much space for players who play on the phone
5,hi i love this game soo much i even played right when its released i just got a new phone now and i finally get to play genshin on this phone but then when i tried to log in to the game it didnt work i used both my username and email but it still didnt work it said invalid account format and account or password error pls help me i dont know wht to do tt
2,u see the problem is this game is pw or pbe happy bcs i grind so much to get that character work hard to it and i got a disappointment of u like me to play just pls fix the wishing system
5,update it is been almost years since i played genshin impact i have a lots of fun here has several features that make it stand out from other games in the genre it has an expansive open world with a variety of environments to explore it also has an interesting story and characters that players can interact with additionally it has a unique combat system that combines action based combat with elemental abilities thank you so much
4,Very fun game I only wish for more freemogems The game updates frequently and it has plenty of events Update for being a game supported by players for three years we should be getting more then two over 9s of a five star and some extra things The other games by hoyoverse give a free five star and gacha games only do well with the support of the players Even if they do not give a free five star atleast give twenty more pulls even if it is for standard Because that will satisfy players more then zero pulls on limited
1,hello my name is david i have a ten year old daughter that download this game and wasted almost all her storage she keeps begging for crystal for something called primoujems of course we did not buy her any but she keeps talking about how much she likes a character named worlfwarthesllay it is a hard name she keeps asking me for primoujems to roll for him so we sent her to sleep in the church and be dumped in holy water stay save my childrens
2,the game is amazing but it does not reward their long time players also the lack of end game combat contradicts the gameplay
5,definitely takes elements from other games but overall definitely fun to play regardless certainly not as high quality as games such as detroit become human god of war ragnarok or stray but i can say for certain this game is so very enjoyable nonetheless and it is free to play unlike the three i just listed if you are broke but want something of good quality with enjoyable gameplay i would highly recommend this game
5,it was so pretty amazing and very exciting perfect for gamers who wanna have adventures and go through different missions or quest it was so addicting game and pretty fun you can also join other servers if you want to have some accompany
3,here we are almost years into this game now mihoyo hoyoverse has repeatedly pissed off its player base does not seem to really listen to our feedback or at least they do not care and many players such as myself are struggling to stay interested most of my friends who played have already quit i am barely holding on hoping that hoyo will pull their head out of their collective a and make the improvements and changes that we have been begging for but i have a feeling they will not
5,i love the game its full of stuff to do especially if you just started there is co op mode so we can play with others and make new friends there is many rewards and many different events genshin impact has something that many games do not and it is open world exploration for quests you have to explore the world of teyvat and unlock teleport waypoints i really like everything in genshin impact from the characters to the music
5,i absolutely adore genshin impact the graphics‚ characters and story line are amazing the only downfall is how much space it takes up
5,this is one of the best games i have played so far and whats best is that it is all comes free like its fully upto you if u want to spend money or not and even if u do not it will not restrict your account level up or anything at all first of all it has already proved that it is one of the best games out there with sixty to seventy m active players monthly when its zone for old gen games like league of legends minecraft and fps like pubg overwatch being new release compared to them
4,i love the gameplay since starting i couldnt put it down now i am having issues with the app randomly cutting off in mid gameplay this is my only frustrating matter
1,very fun but can physically no longer run after fontaine update would not recommend to mobile players even if you have the space now you will likely run out with future updates and it will be a frustrating loss of everything you have worked on my laptop cannot even run it
5,love this game i have been playing almost since the first release and i have enjoyed playing it graphics are great soundtracks ate awesome and the storyline is highly enjoyable
2,very fun game i only wish for more freemogems the game updates frequently and it has plenty of events update for being a game supported by players for three years we should be getting more then two over nine of a five star and some extra things the other games by hoyoverse give a free five star and gacha games only do well with the support of the players even if they do not give a free five star atleast give twenty more pulls even if it is for standard because that will satisfy players more then twenty pulls on limited
5,one of my best games the characters fivehe gamestyle the events the quests everything perfect but it takes a lot of space
1,literally just the shell of a game made to have money poured into it by weebs and whales there is no literally no gameplay other than mashing attack and ability buttons at enemies and hoping their health decreases faster than yours
4,good graphics and quality the story is amazing the attacks effects are just but there should be a skip quest for some unnecessary parts of quests that it the only thing j think this game lacks in my opinion
5,i think it is really fun i love all the new characters but two things it take soo much storage but that is inevitable the second thing is i wish we get primos daily like maybe ten a day or something other than that it is amazing
1,this game is not for phones anymore cannot even do co op because it is laggy you cannot fight raiden or any of those bosses because yet again laggy and you will just be dead by the time your in this game truly just is not for a phone does not matter which phone it is it sucks and there is no more point of playing it anymore if you cannot even play it these updates are great it is probably a beautiful game on console or pc but it aint for phone or poor people
4,i love the graphics of the game and i like the characters but the loading tales very long
5,this is a great yame but i do have one problem as in the ground is black pixles and is dificult to play with it
4,it is an amazing game worth five stars but i am giving you only four stars because this game does not support xbox controller on android but ios version does please make xbox controller usable for better gaming experience on android
5,so awesome god everything is so the art the adventure are exciting how the story work so oh i cannot tell you play you see its just perfect
2,why are your story quests so long why is everything so long and why does everything have to be done the hard way its honestly tiring listening to the storys we all know for a fact eveyone skips them
4,i love the game it is a must play but it takes up too much space on my device every single update it has it takes about twenty percent of my storage i know that this can not be fixed but i am just letting you know hopefully you will find a fix i really love genshin but for phone users they cannot enjoy the game due to it taking up so much storage
3,i would love to try it but seven gb is too much takes so much time to download for an resource download
4,it is perfect games with art and gameplay cool but it not suitable with my phone when having phone performance is low
3,i gave five stars because this game was so much fun back then but now i feel genshin becoming sucks and all the things inside the game is suck as well a lot of things happened but genshins devs are just doing nothing if it compared to it is sister game from the same company i do not know if its still becoming suck like this i just gonna stop and uninstall thanks for everything
5,it is the best open world game i have ever played it is also very relaxed and a satisfying name so i highly recommend this game it is free and quality is just awesome and it runs very fast the story mode is very interesting i just kinda wish you could customize yourself like all games but it is what it is but overall it is a very good game
3,genshin impact is fun and sort of easy to play i understand that i do not have wifi and all but i am tried of constantly lagging when my connection is perfectly fine and this eventually leads to the game crashing and i was also forced to delete and redownload the in order to update it i have played genshin before but i couldnt really play on my old phone but i got a new one a few days ago due to the old one breaking and the new one it works perfectly fine
3,there is nothing engaging to play when there is nothing to do sure i love the consistent update but it is every forty days and it just all the same with nothing new so at least added more permanent content that related to your character strength the main reason why people play this game is to fight using their character not listening to bloated unnecessary dialogue years already i do not put much hope i probably quit when wuthering waves comes out
5,this game has very good graphics although the storage is a wee bit high but i get it also i have cannot finish the fishing quest cause i somehow cannot catch the fish the bar will not show up
5,very nice game i have been playing this for a year and i would say this is my top favorite game in my game list i love all part of this game the combat adventure solving mechanisms and the last is the graphics i just have one request make other ways to game resin because most playerd like me who played this game for a year just want a resin to spend in a game or add more events on the way that is all overall ilove this game
3,this game is addictive af but i came to play a game and am forced to watch just as much cut scene cartoons as there is game play time if i wanted to watch tv i would have just watched tv how about a skip option for those of us that do not care one bit about the five minute back story cartoons every five minutes of game play
5,seriously i have enjoyed this game since i started playing it the downloads are super worth it when you enter the real game highly suggested if you like adventurous games
1,this game is bias to liyue characters since they always have events but nations like inazuma barely have focus events i swear this game hate inazuma because it is based on japan and has extreme bias to liyue because it is china i am sick of seeing zhongli venti hu tao and xiao on every event
5,i love this game he is so incredible and amazing caracters are so beautiful and they are gameplay are so satisfying and cool
1,if i could play this game i would but when i hit start game it goes to the code nineten over tenseven zero or something about not enough storage so i put is on my sd card with more than enough storage and then i went into the game and it was only a black screen nothing else so i moved it back and then it did the stubid error code i tried every thing but it did nothing can you pls fix this cuz i really want to try playing it but i cannot
5,this game is honestly so fun but the down side is that i have the worst luck unfortunately either then that i think this game is absolutely amazing i never want the game to end but when u beat the game u can try out the other twin and see how their journey goes hope this short review helps five stars definitely worth it
5,the game is stunning and the graphics and the vast open world is really detailed and have a beautiful character with beautiful storyline genshin is the most beautiful mmo rpg game that i can ever find
5,ten over ten the only thing that bugs me is when you go into the event or survey it this makes you log out of game and then it has to reconnect to server but even from that it is still a great game graphics are amazing and i love deliuc
5,the game has a lot of lagging on mobile devices sometimes it is bearable and otherwise it is not playable i hope that you make it possible to play it without much system requirements
1,the game has progress so far but some of the basic features are not available with the games such as controller support in android however same is available with ios and other platform we love this game but not able to play to fullest
5,i have been playing it for a year now and enjoyed every bit of it i play this star rail and honkai so this does not get all my attention all the time sadly and when all the desert updates came round it really got boring but now fontaine is in a few days it is dragging my attention back and i hope to enjoy it till the very end
3,this game is amazing and so nice but as a mobile player i do not like how the logging in screen is so long and annoying and when i go to another app for a few seconds my genshin resets and puts me back to the opening screen it pisses me off so much
4,the game was fun and i really enjoyed it the story is very fun and the amount of things you can do makes the game very engaging it does take a bit to load and takes up quite a bit of storage but it is worth it the characters all have their own designs and the game play is peak highly recommend
5,best game ever the experience feels live like you can feel the action not just in game but in real life too
5,cannot actually believe this game is free thoroughly enjoying it and there does not seem to be a pay wall in sight definitely recommend
5,the quest i am going still will not work i do not know if it is a quest or not but it is the mystery ore quest thing where you have to shape it it will not let me do anything on that quest is there a way to reset that quest
4,the game is great and all i have played it for a year and have not encountered any bugs so far the fontaine update is cool too i am loving the underwater exploration but i have a problem regarding the four update ever since i have updated the game when i open it it is always stuck in the loading game screen and no not the loading screen where you can see the vision elements symbol but the game screen you know that thing people thought is celestia or something and idk what to call it
1,game keeps crashing thank god i went through the whole download for hours to have this happen it is junk
2,i waited more than hours just to download this game but unfortunately it freezes before the game even started this is the first time it happened to my cp after so many games that i have tried there must be something wrong with this game i am absolutely disappointed
1,i have deleted everything off my phone and still insufficient memory wonderful screw your commercials on facebook report report
5,four star because i love it and i really enjoy the story quest and the thrill when you wish for a character but get disappoint real quick and of course the character they are so hottie but seriously star because the glitch it is really hard to play genshin on your phone like dvalin who i only see different kind of shape and color and i do not really care about the storage because wifi is my problem i accidentally delete this and i am here suffering downloading the resource we do not have wifi
4,surprisingly high quality for a mobile game like actual videogame kinda game i have some nitpicks with it though mainly related to its gacha monetization system and the horribly uninteresting main protags but otherwise the games legitimately interesting both gameplay wise and background lore main story lore is eh idk the main protags traveller and paimon are absolute mistakes and literally anything could be a better replacement to them at this point if it is to fix the main story
3,best graphics and smooth gameplay but the problem is it is a high files size and has a server problem and also it consumes a lot of battery charge and does not play offline
1,i just updated the app today for the four update and for some reason when i tried opening the game it is says i have no storage space for the game for no reason and it is downloading stop at eighty four pls what is going onhelp
5,i play on phone and playstation it is seems to be a great game so far allot of grinding the typical rpg game with a few new refreshing mechanics
5,genshin impact is beautiful and pretty with beautiful animation but i hope there is more nation and more pretty character
5,i love how it is a open world and you can play with friends and family and the way it is hard to get more unlockable characters
5,so i play this game since i think the release of inazuma so like version two point zero and and i have become a huge fan of this game what inspired me to play this game were the graphics and the fact that it was a huge open world plus it was covid time and i had nothing else to do now i cannot say that sometime it gets a little boring especially in the last few patches before the release of the new region when it is like this i take a break i did like this before the release of fontaine and now i am back
5,the game has been very fun having lot of times playing but like the gliding so much but i really wish we could transfer our day at to other country servers
5,ive been playing this game since twenty twenty one and its a great game sure there is times where content is not being produced and where it does become boring but it is a fantastic game not so much on mobile as the game is super chunky but on pc or console its an amazing experience also the archon quests atleast for fontaine are amazing all in all if your looking for a game to waste your time on this is a good option
4,okay every time i play one game it literally tells me to download this game but there is something to this game so whenever i was trying to log in after i put the last thing which was the password but it kept saying an error so i kept trying to do it but instead it kept telling me that i was a bot
4,has high quality graphics awesome songs and gameplay and many nice husbandos and waifus to choose from not much for main story rn but many sub quests and fillers gacha is just okay every update gives decent amount of primogems to farm save properly and can roll for gacha downsides for this game are the lack of fun in solving most puzzles artifact farming is also boring needs lots of grinding that also needs luck to get decent stats to make characters more stronger overall good free to play game
5,i love mihoyo games they always put a lot of effort and dedication genshin impact is one of their great ones of all time from the music art characters plot story quests almost everything from the game is great my only problem is that it is very heavy in mobile devices especially each update but it was understandable considering how much detail are put in the game i would still play it regardless because this is a great game one of the best open world rpg out there highly recommendable
5,i really enjoy the new gameplay detective and attorney but there are some new bug when i use wanderer skill on the elevator and press it again to unfloat the floor of the elevator vanish and wanderer falling down indefinitely
5,this is so adventurous game and interesting plot but the only problem is the teleport way is so many my suggestions is remove the other teleportion and make a transportations like horse
2,poor incentive reward system only things keeping it alive are the characters and the map update high resource storage consumption no gameplay optimisation since the release of the game and still unable to customise controls
5,i love this game and the events are so cool and the story quest for the five star characters is good but the only problem is the lag and the sheer cold in dragonspine it would be more helpful if you make the cryo characters immune to the sheer cold so it can help with the exploration but i still love the game
5,i really love the game it is well optimised running smooth i really like the story stuff and i love it thanks for a game like this
4,as much as i love this game the update is too much for my phone to handle so i am very upset because i currently only have apps facebook honkai star rail and genshin impact i absolutely do not want to delete star rail nor facebook but i still want to continue playing genshin i really do not know what else i can do to continue playing
5,it is a really great game but for some reason my game keeps cutting off when i put it on so please fix this
4,version is not installing tried to start it loaded for an hour i shut down the phone as it was heating up now i get an insufficient space notification while i have five gb available on android phone i cannot play before updating either
4,i like the game that relate to gods and this is perfect i like the characters the story the grapic of the game but if there is no story to do is the game will boring and thats my broblem so i rate it four stars
5,this game is very interesting with all it is adventures im very satisfied with this game its somehow interesting in a way i cant describe well amazing game keep up the work mihoyo
5,i really love the game it has very good quality and the details are fantastic i will play it more in my free time
1,this game is pretty good and i love it dearly but it usually makes me so fed up disappointed and mad because firstly they missed up with the whole sumeru characters designs secondly they do not want to add more abyss challenge increase resin and give buffs to the old characters thirdly the hoyoverse team are not helpful at all whenever i complain about a bug they do not give a helpful answer or they do not respond so i am giving it stars
4,the game is amazing the game play the story the graphics even the character and npc design is absolutely stunning but oh boy it takes up a ton of storage i do not even know if my device will make it past version haha
4,it is too good graphics character designs animation and quests but there is one problem will the downloads aur updates whenever i start the game even after hrs it shows to download fiftysixmb data every time different data pls fix it or insert a option that we can download it later it is a request btw nice game
5,i love furina not satisfied with the lines of traveller and paimon in four but the overall quality of four is so good that i will still give it five stars both focalors and furina are great characters
5,i started playing since twenty twenty two and got hooked because of the adventure and the main story of the game and when i saw that it got released on phones i downloaded it and the graphics are amazing for it being a phone version continue doing your amazing work hoyoverse and i hope this game continues to be the amazing game that it is
4,i love exploring teyat and meeting all the characters the new combat activities ad quest never bore me the only downside is the game size currently with the new fontaine update it takes up fortygb on my phone
2,an overall great game however i used a phone that has sixty fourgb rom and four plus three gb ram and my phone is android version twelve my phone is techno spark go twenty twenty three btw it does not show damage text and frozen water you can also find some players on hoyolab complaining about it so i really hope you fix this because as a student i cannot afford a better phone i would be a great help if you listen to us who has a potato phone welp i do hope you see this and you do something about it
2,after watching the four special program and hearing the rd year anniversary rewards i am so diaappointed but not surprised hyv has been neglecting its genshin fanbase eversince with mediocre anniversary and special event rewards compared to its sister games like hsr and hi rd i just wish they would give loyalty rewards for players who have been active since version one point zero like me it would really make the playerbase especially those who stuck with the game through its highs and lows
4,good graphics the gameplay is fun and entertaining the story is good yet is presented in s terrible way a nice game to get yourself lost in a fantasy world waste a lot of time but enjoy it
4,reduced one star because i need to remove a lot of apps just to update this and updating takes so long and my phone gets way to hot
1,not even for the rd anniversary we received good rewards meanwhile at honkai they give away nice rewards for random events it is a shame because i really liked the game
5,the game is very fun it has a bit of lag but it is not that bad the start is very long the but awesome game
1,the game is absolutely fun and enjoyable however this issue must be addressed right now the ridiculous storage requirements for both pc and mobile is ridiculous we all really need optimization update i lost half of my friends with update due to this games serious amount of storage capacity needed at this rate by start of five point zero no one can play it please hoyoverse fix this
5,this game is really good the graphics story ect as an open world rpg game its chefs kiss my storage is not safe though
5,the characters are just spot on the eyes look very realistic in my opinion but there is no little boy characters you can play as which is kinda untouched but the rest of the game is just amazing i love the strory so much aswell
4,i love the game but can you help me cause when i am diving at my asian server in fontaine unlocking a waypoint my game got crushed i tried to play it again after hours it just loaded for like four mins and when i tried to close it my phone is not responding now i am crying cause i got many goods characters at that server but i also have another server eu but i only have jean as five star there i hope you can help me ty
1,after playing for weeks now it is continuously showing me connection timeout error after starting the game
5,game cool and overall amazing my brothers account got stolen by a russian hacker but he appealed and got it back honestly great team support
5,this is a really nice game the graphics are amazing and the storyline is just great the character designs look incredible and i can tell they must of taken so pomg to create i love this game and so many people around me talk about it non stop so i decided to try it out and here we are playing all the time i just want to say well done to the creators you did an amazing job and you succeeded to impress me well done ten over ten
3,amazing story with great graphics but needs little work on animation while dialogue convection as compared to star rail
5,despite the high demand of storage its fifty gb on phone and one hundred gb on pc it is playable and the visuals is so amazing
5,if you are looking for a beautiful adventurous open world game then this game is for you the combat system is really nice but keep in mind the game isnt too combat heavy edited my post to include how well done the regions of sumeru and fontaine are
1,i have had this game downloaded to my phone for a while i see ads all the time for it but i have yet to be able to play because of the storage issue how much storage does a mobile game need my phone is not a playstation or pc edit twenty gigs
5,the game is fun and all but it is too heavy like the game folder ones i downloaded the game i lost thirty gb storage which is a lot
4,the best game i have ever played there is still a problem the game gets bigger and bigger and now it weights nine gb please consider this issue
5,absolutely amazing no complain whatsoever hoyoverse i am begging you to give me more luck on my pulls or else i will squish you into a pancake using zhonglis meteor j this game does require a lot of storage the current version is not even the full thing there is more and i mean a lot more updates to come so before anyone downloads this game be sure that you have enough storage ehe
5,mondstadt feels a lot like home it is nice to revist some times just to see where my journey began i wonder if others do too liyue another grand adventure i met some of my favourite characters here that i adore still years on inazuma it is urple sumeru a great story with wonderful lore and fantastic characters you can also begin to really see how much their character models have improved over the years fontaine its cool almost makes me wish french people were real
5,i love this game and it is story the only thing that i would say is a bad thing id say is the prices for the digital currency
5,it is a great honestly from gameplay up to graphics everything is marvelous i have been enjoying explorations and always have a blast story wise i believe that this game has got to be one of the games with the best storylines can really put you on a roller coaster of emotions besides the fact that i lost consecutively for and a half years
5,gensgin impact has alot of beautiful scenery and overall its a very fun game but my storage is getting a bit low but it is a fun game
2,the games frame rate suddenly drops making the combat system harder than it should be i play on a sixtygb data phone i would also appreciate if sand physics were added to mobile
5,i think this is five stars because you get to explore the world i get new characters and get to fight and ots really fun
5,it is really fun but i keep getting stuck at a certain point of stamina and adventure rank
5,wow i hope in the future the world in the genshin impact game will expand maybe later there will be more interesting places one day i hope there will be a new place which is where the elements pyro and cryo i also hope that these places are as beautiful as places for example the names are mondstadt liyue inazuma sumeru and fontaine please reading this telling
1,zero over ten would recommend nothing will change this not fontaine natlan etc fontaine is boring af the cast feels lifeless except for people the girls are reduced to pure eye candy the story keeps repeating itself etc and after the treatment of a dehya from sumeru i have no more support for this game after six months of waiting for sumerus best girl they treated her so badly i am done just play honkai impact third instead the devs directly running it know exactly what they are doing
1,never actually treats it is players especially the loyal ones right been playing for every single day for years now and i am still dissapointed
5,this game have very interesting story and the character is just amazing each character had their own backstory and unique personality like a real person i very enjoying doing the archon quest and story quest but there only problem you need a lot of space for this game you need at least twenty gb or more other than that this game is just super amazing i play it all night
1,game worked perfectly fine before ever since the pre installation game takes thirty gb even after clearing all past quest resources and lags a lot and noticed a drop in frame rate needs better optimisation for phones i have enough space to last me a while but game still lags
2,best thing which i like in the game is the low rewards even after playing for years to top it all it is gb in android mobile after installs there are so many new characters which keep coming that old characters do not get a re run banner so you can forget about getting csix of your favourite four star character game is not balanced everything is rng luck artefact domain are really good it makes you feel you can almost get what you want genshin gets you addicted to gambling
3,this game is frequently stressing me out i fully understand and acknowledged about this open world feature but nevertheless the storage requirements for this game is still insane too much rng you need to have a good device or at the very least decent ram for this game to be performing well enough to progress farming become tiring when you are in high ar the community is even worst either normal or they were the most problematic person you ever meet in the fandom customer service suck
5,friendly to use even for newbies i started playing on my phone but later switched to laptop app we play as a family you can visit each others world and help each other out helpful during combat with large enemies i personally enjoy the wandering in open world concept not so much battling in domains often the cut scenes telling a story can be tedious since i do not care much for the lore but my experienced gamer kids do so it depends on your preference the visuals are gorgeous
3,the game is really great i love to play with it all the time but my only problem was it was taking a lot of space of mine the new version just came and i really wanted to keep playing but it was taking too much of my space
5,i really like the game its pretty has very nice aesthetics and amazing open world cool characters and amazing storyline i would always play this game with my friends and explore the world with them
4,this game is amazing the only thing that really bothers me is that the game crashes sometimes for seemingly no reason other than that it is pretty good
5,i like this game but after four update my teleporter suddenly crash after teleporting once i am sure i did not click the home button please mihoyo fix so i can play this normally without getting crash while teleportig
3,hey why there is no option to move the on screen buttons for better control because every player has different style and you are restricting them also the total size of the game is four gb and you missed this thing your game how
5,genshin impact is so fun to play when i am bored i always play it because i could unlock new maps and it is an adventure
4,the best open world mobile game i have ever played the only problem i have faced is the visuals settings i tried playing in sixtyfps but my phone became too hot forty°c
3,visuals are great but that means it doesnt run well on non high end devices
5,three point five k hours on mobile one k hours on pc and one hundred hours on playstation game is amazing have not been playing much of it recently though seen as ive been on honkai starrail since day but with the new area coming really soon ill be on more great sound track can be found on spotify too amazing visuals runs well on old ish devices example one plus five t from twenty seventeen it runs with very little issues on medium settings its also not too difficult i am arfifty wlsix with little struggle
5,absolutely the best free to play game available on android all other developers should take notes on how micro transactions are done by this game there are no ads no annoying pop ups constantly wanting you to buy anything and no pay to win mechanics a
5,amazing made me have a lot of fun with my friends still have a lot of quest to go do highly recommend
5,i love it sooooooooooo much d but i have a problem i pulled for venti and i got him but the game does not let me to use hime or level up him i hope it gets better soon but still i am absolutely in love with this game tysm for making this game
5,lets address the elephant in the room the games only problem is not the game itself these graphics are truly phenomenal it massively suffers from the playerbases reputation for being bad people to no fault of the developers ignore the opinions of the internet try the game for yourself be unbiased and live in truth ave christu rex
2,love it but it is a lot of grinding and i wished it did not take so much to make it look nice lol its ok though my phone is a little on the older side edit wanted to play it again so i had to delete so many apps and files to be able to dl it not sure if imma keep it long since it kills my battery and heats it up too
5,i am giving it five stars for some reason but i am confused if a muslim can play this could you add a way to skip worshiping idols
4,this game has the most awesome graphics if your device is bad running it on max graphics can overheat your phone and you will feel a laggy hoyoverse should do something with this but in the end the coolest game i have ever played is genshin
4,i have been playing this game for half an year pretty good graphic moderate game function cool characters
5,this is my second life living as an adventurer born with power and yeah this game is amazing especially to play with friends
3,the game is amazing it is visuals characters and gameplay are awesome as hell the only problem are the rewards that are way too bad the commissions do not give you the needed primogems for even pull the quests take too much time and again give almost nothing as a reward the events are cool and the developers constantly introduce new mechanics to the game the d anniversary rewards we are awful
3,game looks and feels great lots of things to do but with no game pad support for android is very frustrating game would be five stars otherwise so if u can play on a controller get this game
5,since twenty twenty one joined and still active till now not much fun if not huge spender but acceptable interesting storyline and anime
4,addicting as hell gameplay is stunning graphics are beautiful fplay but money helps wish there was more darker skinned characters and diversity takes a lot of space on ur phone but somehow runs smoother than on my pc
5,really love this game however i would love controller support for android phones so i can play on mobile more often
3,it is okay but the controls are terrible i wish i could adjust the buttons on a way i am comfortable with it plus add a controller setting in android just like in ios i am tired of using third party apps to integrate my controller on the buttons
1,character level up materials for leveling up talents are very hard to get it is been five weeks and still have not got any tail of boreas it is so frustrating why make the respawn time of rewards be that long why make us wait for another to week just to get what the item we do not need
4,i love this game i love the storyline of it but i joined back once and i had to restart everything and i do not know why if you could help i would be very grateful edit i fixed it but i lost two of my characters and i cannot seem to get them back some help would be greatly appreciated
5,the game is beautiful and fun to play can get a bit repetitive after a while though
1,geshin impact its kinda cool all the characters designs etc are so amazing but i have a issue the problem is the storage well i just playing geshin impact i am trying to start the game but did not work plus i delete all the pictures and apps and does not work plus and the downloading screen is kinda slow please fix this issue thank you i hope i can play geshin impact
4,its a great game my favorite actually the only thing is that it fills up insane amounts of storage i cant play it anymore because the space it fills has become too much and i cant update it due to lack of storage
1,i keep on losing on limited banners and i got mona qiqi etc which is so annoying they are in the standard banner and yet still in limited banner we got characters from standard banner
4,it is a good game but me and my cousin cannot really play it maybe because i just started but maybe you guys can fix it please i do not know what i am supposed to do or maybe it is because i have out of either way it is not letting me player or i am just do not know how to play because when they first shows up i just see like stairs maybe it is just logging in and taking a long time but i do not think so and then their circle and l click on it and this is to put my username and password
5,just play the game and try abyss and explore the map this game is perfect and you dont need to play this game for every second you can play free to play and genshin is so fun for play even in fp
5,best game ever i play it everyday and i totally recommend it but with the update i cannot open the party menu and the game crashes not sure if it is my pc but if possible in the four update can you add a feature to disable the party animations thank you
1,when i try to play the game and log it it suddenly freezes and kicks me out of the game and i cannot even play it anymore
1,as an arsixty player i can say that the scenery exploration and story is quite good however the gacha aspect is extremely predatory and the company is one of the greediest giving barely any currency for gacha it will take you months to save up for a five star character and you may not even get the one you want only play it if you are going in for pure exploration and story and have good self control
5,i have been playing for a few days now and the game is just amazing the story quests and the adventures it is so challenging and that is what i like most the voice actors did a wonderful job too this is probably the best game i played
1,not really friendly for mid or entry level smart phones you will encounter several visual glitches and sometimes crashes it would be cool if they fixed this issue but i do not think it will solved soon
5,super great game full of arts i wish i can destroy everything like gta san andress and can hurt civilian and can play with more than people like ragnarok
4,it is a really good game my only main issues are that if you join later than you have missed out on all the events like it is a massive fomo trap and i wish you could have like a way of getting the specified rewards that you cannot just get anywhere like the little seelies that follow you around idk what they are called and to make it free to play bcus not everyone can afford to spend money on games other than that i love the game
4,i love the game it is nice and is really good with art and other fields it has many characters i just wish you could level up the adventure rank faster
5,great game still the best since two point four update but we do hope that by next major updates please add more places exiting mechanism similar to summertime fantasia and secret summer paradise and return those artistic character physics and character behavior that once present in cbt and once removed from patch one point zero to one point eight onwards
3,after i updated it for the rd anniversary it will not let me play it keeps freezing or crashing or lagging please help
3,the game is good but the storage it takes is impossible please make it need less storage i have to delete so many h pictures and games just to be able to play one update it is rather annoying
4,i play on android it is pretty hard to play on android since every time i go to inazuma it kicks me out a takes a awhile for me to re join but other than that it is a good game
3,anything needs resin while stock resin is very limited and even dropping artifacts from the domain does not guarantee that you will get what you need even if you spend a lot of resin i beg you make this game easier and more comfortable to play because anything needs resin to make we as players who do not buy items in the game find it difficult to play this game at least add resin stock with a shorter recovery time than before
5,best open world rpg game for mobile yet the combat is simple and fun the exploration and world is top tier the music also banger no end game yet i dont care about the end game actually the story is great in the beginning but its getting better n better trust me warning some of the fans kinda weird they try to ship char in the game i mean in the most weirdest way just ignore them
3,entertaining cute characters very catchy game make sure you have time because you will get stuck to this game edit game does turn a bit stale after rank forty or so where the free to play or average players grind for characters and other stuff turns really boring
3,i agree that this game is very aesthetically pleasing but it lacks in all the other departments you have to constantly grind for materials to be able to achieve anything there is so much to discover and to do to complete everything the game has to offer probably takes hundreds and thousands of hours and it is quite demotivating the story is shallow the characters are predictable the puzzles are basic and repetitive the combat is just smashing keys the coop sucks too
5,thumbs up for creating this game with wonderful graphics and entertaining battle gameplay and open world exploration if i may suggest for your future upgrades please add a mount to ride on for easier exploration of the vast teyvat and also an auto loot of monster drops should really enhance the experience of genshin gamers good job mihoyo more power
4,i really liked the game and all and i understand it is for the player but i really think that the resources and all takes too much space
4,well it is a very nice game but it takes five h to download and it takes thirty g of storage and it says three hundred m of storage my grandmother phone even with o storage she couldnt download it trust me
4,i love the game but really wish they would optimize the android version or add something like controller support
4,it is a very good game for those who love anime and manga manhua but there is a network problem some time it is a bad side this game does lag on mobile player but it is not happened very time lastly i will say the game graphics is best
5,love the graphics open world many things to do many characters to choose from overtime as you collect them something i still enjoy playing lots
5,very cool experience it is a fantastic game for android mobile having a beautiful grafic beautiful nature and so much adventure i like it very much
5,awesome game love this game from all aspects good storyline awesome character designs perfect
5,i love this game so much the gameplay graphic character design all of that is perfect the best game ever i will not say the rng or gacha system is bad because it is like that we can play as free to play anyway so i will not bother
3,mm the coop is unbalanced but fun the game as a whole is a bit unbalanced
1,i hate this game because it does not have a skip button for the dialogue because i have so many story to catch up to the previous one please i have wait for year to you make the skip button i need it to complete all my mission it make me soo sleepy when the talking things please make a skip button for the dialogue please
5,one bothers me is that players need to wait until it is fully sixty resin i have patience but i would like to suggest to reduce the time and making the resin fill up a little faster this advantage will help building their characters even more fast and good other else is very amusing and i enjoy this game a lot
5,this is one of the best games ever the only problem is that it is a gacha game so people like to hate on it because it also has a bit trash community which makes people think differently about the game for me it is a mno rpg open world combat game with gacha elements that has a very interesting story lore etc i really recommend this game if you like mno rpg open world games and if you have have alot of free time storage and mental health to sacrifice
4,genshin is a fun app to play and all the problems that i got many years ago is already been fix its just the storage space of the game that bugs me that is why i rate it to a four instead of a five over all the gameplay and story is fun
1,i gave this an star because last time i log out i was ar thirty and when i came back i was back at ar one i do not know what happened but i tried to email hoyovers but it did not work i lost so many progress in this game and it did not even save
1,my phone space is four gb ram but they said download data is eight gb how this possible this i cannot play this game but i really want to play this game can you solve this problem
5,best game ever mihoyo games are always fun some of the players always find something to be annoyed about but i seriously do not care about those kinds of players i just want to enjoy the game beautiful breathtaking visuals and just a perfect game for people like me thank you for everything mihoyo
1,i have been locked out for a year we have tried everything it is my favorite game and i cant even play it
5,perfect in every way just make the app a little smaller for example delete the data from lets say every update is just more gigs of storage consumed
3,the game is fun to some point the main story is kinda good but the problem is it tells the story like its explaining it to an mentally retarded person for example you understand the situation and expect the dialogue to end but then paimon comes out and says omg thats this then so the game is overly explanatory and the edgy accent of the characters makes me wanna puke except those it is a pretty fun game with grind cycling and some story with it mihoyo please do not continue like this
2,it hurts me so much that i have been playing this game for months and did not get a single five star when literally my friend who just played it a week ago got a five star mona and i just draw earlier and ofc i got collie who i already have i literally saved that forty sixsix primogens for five days please yall better give me a reason to not delete your game
3,love this game but not entirelly because i cannot play it in my samsung tab s seven with an playstation controller and i have seen that ipads can do it
5,i love this game a little too much xd the story is the most captivating part in my opinion
5,most likely the designs of each character and the map is what makes me rate this high
1,the game is fine its good the combat is ehhh nothing impressive cause the game keeps updating but there is nothing new to the combat issue is the hell is wrong with this game took me an hours to download to play the game very poorly why would you set an openworld single player game to fully dependent on good connection why i cant play game cassually as the lag of connection keep goes on cant even play the game as cassual game supposedly yep dont play the game if you have limited time
4,fun to play but the game are is so demanding you need a high end phone to play these games smoothly but the game itself is great
4,the graphics are amazing it is a good game the characters are great and the visuals too
5,i was actually not going to play this game when my friend introduced it to me but after watching the ads i was too annoyed with it so i downloaded it and give it a try now i am addicted to it especially some characters their design is too beautiful and i enjoy reading the lore too i play this game for almost two yrs and i am still in love with it
1,it is very bad because i am on a chromebook and it still shows the setting that you use on an ipad
3,this game is better than i thought it would be going into it but i still have mixed feelings dailies feel boring and drawn out characters and thier gear cost too many primos in game resources and theres not much to do in late game other that spiral abyss i do think genshin is a good game tho and worth trying even for people who dont like gacha games
3,genuinely really love this game i have been playing for over three years now i am starting to get burnt out on it but that is bound to happen with all the repetition very gorgeous graphics and all but especially for mobile players the amount of space it takes up is ridiculous i recently had to switch to my playstation because even my computer did not have enough space for it i do not have the best computer but if it did not fit after deleting almost everything that should say something
5,friggin amazing app i could play this all the time i rlly like adventuring the world but sadly i have not opened the inazuma map
5,been in the fandom for over a year but was not able to play until recently but i have to say this game was a major change in my life best ztory characters lore all this is absolutly amaznig things that make this game the best i have seen in my life although the storage is a major problem but the game is absolutly marvelous
5,i absolutely love this sht dawg i hope that it will not take me for a while to get like a million primogems playing this game gave me a chance to take a break from my stress from classes and exams and from other pvp platforms and a chance to explore something glorious i hope this game will not turn me into a fatass discord mod wait i forgot something i dodnt have a discord xd anyways pls give me five stars or four stars characters or weapons thank you btw
4,it is a really good game but the loading and updating process is really slow takes forever
2,i have waited sixhrs and i cannot play the game my router is perfectly fine and no problems with good connection and i even uninstall and install repeatedly and i cannot enter the game it says error forty yet my other games that require wifi did not have this problem only genshin it sounds like you do not want me to play your game which is truly unfortunate because i enjoyed it before such a shame here is for making my game experience worse a star bad review for you and i am from asia server
4,the only game i play i have stopped playing all others my only point of concern is the enormous and ever growing app size it is insane mihoyo needs to do smthng to relieve the pressure of storage on mobile phone users
4,this is very good even tho i have not even played it yet cause of my storage space but ive been a fan of this amazing work
5,overall i have had a really fun time playing the combat is easy to understand and quick to learn the characters are amazing and all feel different and it is still a challenging game
4,i love this game it has so many different characters cool designs a great storyline but there are some problems for one this game takes up an insane amount of storage space the only other thing is i wish that you could swap between different teams more efficiently instead of going to the paimon menu and selecting party setup and switching it that way other than those issues the game is great i recommend downloading on pc or playstation playstation xbox because it runs smoother
4,very good game cause addiction very not free to play friendly u have to spend alot alot of phone usage like storage and ram and processer causes overheating super quickly
5,cons network based heating issue storage chip damaged power consumption high glitches bugs daily updates pros fantasy movie experience graphics is a lit gameplay joystick multi platform wings good story graphic
1,what happened why i cannot login to the game it only shows up with black screen and then it back to the homescreen i am really disappointed
5,great game please add more nations i love it but please add an option to save all the data that you download into an file so that incase anyone deletes genshin impact accidently they would not need to go through the hell of hours of download
3,i totally love it the best game i have ever imagine to play but there is an issue every update need a big space this game is over twenty gb right now is it going to take all my space do something about it please stop new versions and stop asking for more space it seems endless and please add a button to skip those boring dialogues
5,so far so good after days grinding planning to be a free to play player hopefully it goes well
5,this game is really fun to adventure the grafics is really good no bugs the character is amazing just need another sound efect from the characters
5,this game is really fun actually i just started playing but i could tell that the details and the storyline in the game is really awesome one problem though it sometimes kicks me out of the game for no reason i hope u can fix this
5,it is great game my favourite game after the walking dead game series but can you add game controller support on android i play on my pc but also play on my android and i really like if add controller support x box controller
5,amazing game was recommended to play byt was hesitant but once i started playing i have not stopped
5,good great and i very enjoyed playing this game but i am sooooo unlucky i only have five stars characters sbut it is alright as long as this game continue being such a good game i recommend this game to everyone it has lots of positive things like good graphics good story line great animation and lots of fun and compliment tasks to do thanks for making this game and i hope to continue developing this game my thanks
5,has a very good themed graphics a long story and more to explore even it has multiplayer after adventure rank eight i feel it worth for the space it occupies
5,this is one of some of the best games in mobile i been playing it for like a year it has good gameplay character design and nice open world but the only problem is the storage and the how hard is to get a character other than that this is one of the best
5,i play this game for about years now daily and i gotta admit this is the first game that makes me obsessed you gotta admit that the storyline and the music in this game is top tier but still artifact grinding is killing those fun time but i will still consider playing genshin from now on to the future
3,its not letting me in everytime i go on the game it gitches and kicks him out when it reaches geo or my phone freezes and doesnt work please fix this bug over all i love the game but after updating it i cant get in
1,size of the game is ridicilous it takes a lot of space and the game performance in mobile is worsened the update patch does not give player something like hsr do and a lot of player leaving this game even the new update like fontaine and else i hope at the anniversary later they can do much better improving the game and rewarding the player who still played this
5,incredible i cannot believe i can play this game on my phone do not get me wrong the initial update after download took literal hours but once that was done it is been nothing but smooth sailing after that
5,my opinion it is really good judge by graphic gameplay and the character design with new outfit that really pretty it make the environment change last it is wish my luck to get keqing from standard banner t t
5,one of the best anime game i have played on mobile the lore quests characters and weapons are just exquisite it is a well developed game with variety of locations with very adorable graphics excellent job done by mihoyo
1,i was playing this game from the start and the game was amazing but now it requires fifty mb five gb data to download just to play a game on a mobile please optimise it for mobiles or you well lose the players who love the games but do not have the space to download now my journey with genshin impact have reached its end until the game is again playable
5,from scenery to music to characters to story to diversity in music and regions to overall visuals everything thing is top notch edit please work on the lag a little even if i use both wifi and mobile data it is still laging
4,i have played this game for a year i enjoy it alot eksept for the amount of storage and the long loading to just login
1,love the game but hate the lack of controller support i play it on pc only because of this
3,i have been intrested in this game but i cannot play it because of error nineninetyseven or insufficient storage space error my storage is clear i have tried ever thing to fix it but i can find a vidoe on how to fix it on a chromebook and it is making me mad so if some one could help me i will take all the help i can get
5,lovely game music and colorful graphics are wonderful and it is free to play
3,amazing game but need more in game events not just an event that stretched to a week and have to wait everyday to unlock new progress on the other hand i played since it is first release but even until now i do not have good artifacts roll
5,either planned or damage control i got the rewards with more to come what more could i ask for really
2,so i downloaded the game but it would not let me actually play the game because everytime i logged in it said that there was an error
5,i like the graphics and everything on mobile but the problem is that mobile players cannot see the damage atack text on the screen ice for element burst for cryo characters and grass and it is bothering me as well if you could squeeze in those stuff in the next update mobile players and me would appreciate it
5,it is good game but i cannot play it anymore because of lag ik it is from my device it is starting when i update it into android i wanna go back to android now
5,it is an amazing game i just love the animation and the characters are just perfect
2,i wonder what is in the end of story of twin how many years does i spend playing this game maybe its to far from this day maybe do i wish to easily get a rare artifact even in rare artifact in just month ill be happy with that but i spent a year but i aint got a good perfect one why is that hoyo and also very poor server in ph even i have a good network
1,today i played for two hours got bored a while back but decided to give it another try i am ar fifty nine i fought six enemies for around five seconds and the rest was spent looking at one fifty nine fifty five of unskippable boring bad filler dialogue this used to be an amazing game but now it has zero respect for your time there is almost no adventuring and everything that was clever about it is gone new content coming with every update is brainless and painfully boring
5,if anime and zelda botw got together this would be it it is really enjoyable and fun
4,i really like this game but i do not know why it keep on crashing i even reinstalled it times a week but nothing happens and due to this i am missing all the events
5,great game really nice graphics the only thing is it would be nice if they would allow you to gift thing to your friends
4,its a really amazing game tho i am stuck on the loading screen i keep crashing on the loading screen on the element it logs all of the element but the geo one keeps coming back and leaving i do not know what to do but overall it is really good game and it is addicting to play
5,hello please solve my problem it will take a few days when i enter the game it crashes and crashes and my phone memory is twenty gigs empty my phone model is sharp aquos rfive g
4,genshin impact is truly a breathtaking game with stunning views serene music and amazing characters with eye catching stories it truly is the best rpg game that i have played and enjoyed and hope to play in the long run until the end of the story the only thing that is an issue is the amount of storage space it takes now and i hope that the cloud feature becomes available for fps in my and many other countries as soon as possible
1,i have just faced the most irritating problem the gb update i have waited for at least four hours to get done was cancelled the last minute by a verification error it is the second time this happened to me and it is really disappointing it is definitely not about my pc my equipment meets all the requirement and standards i just hope they will find a solution about this issue with the launcher edit tried again but no avail and ofc there is no way hoyo will listen to this complaint and solve it
1,game do not work i have forty eight gb free uninstalled it reinstalled it times still tells me insufficient storage
5,absolutely amazing storyline and writing beautiful graphics and character designs
5,this game has amazing graphics and story line but it is better played on playstation
5,returning player highly excited to continue honing vr control experience via here this companys third person games i have played have influenced my dreams as magically as the disney esque glass and emerald floating castle i find myself phasing through as a ghost in them when i cannot play maybe because of these comments we could see bigger model playable characters gotta love the angelic avatar of different elements like earth and steel themes hows your overlaiden constellation collection
5,this game is amazing it is been an year since i started playing this and it is by far my favourite game the updates characters regions story graphics and everything i love it so much
5,an amazing game and the graphic is amazing and lot of stuff to do great game
5,i am editing this reviev after playing and my opinion has changed for the better many people complain about the rewards but they are just about fine to me the gameplay is great and the story is interesting but sometimes the quests are too long such as the aranara storyline the exploration aspect is my favorite about the game it is just perfect it takes a lot of space but deffo worth it
5,the game is good but is has some problems like some characters are just bad or not good no skip button and not alot of good rewards
5,i love this game so much amazing storyline character design backstories for each character and nation i love how the combat system is set up and how you do not need to pay money to get character or weapons you want fontaine is near ladies and gentlemen prepare yourselves
4,overall great game but you will pretty much ran out of content in a few days of playing and will be mindless farming and with the resin system that forces you to be able to farm them only a few times a day makes it harder to farm and the artifacts are rng on top of rng on top of rng so you really need high luck or absurd amount of resin to get a possible good piece
5,i love the game but it is lack of free to play things need many primogems to get the character i want
3,i enjoy the game and game play but doing maintenance right after an update so i cannot get on and do nothing need to work on better timing with that bs
2,i honestly love the game but from on today why why is everything sensored me dmg crit long i cannot even say a word without it being messed up because it is sensored pleasee fix this its turning into roblox but worse
5,genshin impact is such a great game it would great available at all platforms and with great graphics nevertheless the characters are all detailed and with great stories like my absolutely beautiful scaramouche kunikuzushi kabukimono wanderer the game story lore is well made and i can promise it will keep you hooked for days also genshin if you do not let me win my i will give a one star
5,this is the best game i have ever played i have been playing genshin for about years now and even though i am a pay to play it is still completely possible to play the game with all the functions as a free to play though it is going to be a struggle to get new character as a free to play so i recommend saving for a specific character instead of wishing every single time you can get a ten pull that is just my advice though it does take alot of storage though but it has good graphics five stars
4,the game is very good but sometimes i have to change my account because sometimes my account can get very weird
1,please fix your game there is a bug for some devices where you can not see dmg numbers ice or grass it is very annoying and stupid
2,still no controller support after years of waiting i do not think the developers care about android users at all the game is fun on console but a hassle on mobile the most recent events are unplayable on android
2,story is really good character designs are really good too but where the hell is quality of life sleep for last four year hsr was launched five six months ago and there has already added stuff that every genshin player had asked for in last four years why development team of this game is sooo bad i just cannot believe it they do not even care all they care about is making money instead of listening to there player base request i hope after looking at hsr development team is team learns something
5,i love open world games especially with a cool storyline to go with it it is a fun experience and i love it so much
3,not bad but mostly farming for items and cannot do any emotes r anything similar gotta pay for good characters not pay to play but pay to get good stuff
3,the game is pretty fun and i enjoy every single minute in it but when i wanted to play with my friend on the american server i have to change the acc and lose all the data i really wish mihoyo would change this so that i would change the servers without losing progress
4,great game playing for over a year on android the game is lagging with every update i request the developers to optimize the game so that it runs smoother on phone especially budget phones
2,the exploration and main story are five stars the side stories are stars the character visual design is four stars and their gameplay is stars they keep making four star characters very focused on either supporting or less characters in the entire roster or part of an unpopular niche such as physical dps
4,i think it is the best game in android but when i still play it my mobile gets very hot
1,not enough resins full with time base events useless boring co op function side quests are better than main quests nd anni rewards sucks just make venti meta again please
3,taking for too long to load but still good like when it says press to begin i pressed the door and then it is taking to long to load like really long it is just like it frozen but the game is still good hope you guys fix this problem if the game
5,i like the game tho the game can be quite laggy sometimes but it doesnt bother me in any way keep up the great work
5,genshin impact is such an amazing game the storyline the details the characters etc everything is so unique i have been playing ever since the game came out and i am so thankful that mihoyo made this game i would recommend playing this game a lot to keep up with the events and stuff like that
1,the game is cool and all but recently i opened a new acc and almost completed downloading my resources but the game had some errors and i had to start all over again i took it lightly and just let it go but it happened to me again and it is not a joke anymore coz downloading the resources takes a lot of time and net you should do something about this the game do not even remember my saved acc and i need to start all over again its frustrating
4,it is good it plays fine the graphics are amazing but it makes my phone as hot as the sun
4,it is a good game but it takes forever to do a quest and once we finish it we barely get any primogems
5,ill have issues on my old account now must restart back long journey ill guess the best adventure game try it traveler
5,still the best game still having problems with space probably this will be my last update on the game due to lack of space to update i will be pleased if tou found a way for example being able to space it on an sd card or on cloud to dramatically reduce the space of the game thank you for this lovely trip on a beautiful magical world hoyo
5,the best open world rpg game ever regular updates graphics stories characters and soo much more easily the best game
4,best game combat open world exploration strategy adventure hidden stuff quizzes and lots of great stuff but the storage after four update is thirty gb we can understand that u dont wanna reduce quality but that at the sake of many many ppl not being able to play the game is not good either make some downloads a bit dynamic so that we will download that content only if we want to voice background stories and advance graphic files can be optional also make a deaddiction centre
5,the best mobile game i have ever played the graphics are perfect you guys should try out this game
1,as an end game player i simply cannot recommend this game some four star characters are really strong and you would need to build them in order to progress in your account but guess what there is no guarantee for a specific four star you desperately need also everything in this game is resin gated which is basically time gated you have ten mins of gameplay everyday to progress your account and artifact rng is a curse which will drive you crazy also system for banner five star is not ideal
4,it is all good but does not have a pvp option on top of that it is a gacha game sooooo it is very tough for the free to play players to keep up
2,the external game download for genshin in windows is very slow please fix it
4,i love the game the experience the exploration this game is like thirty gb wish more combos just started game it is rlly fun i do not usually play animes tbh
4,good game over all but recently e and my friend had this problem we has always played co op shes on playstation and i am on mobile but on july th when we went on to play she tried to join me but it said i was offline and when she tried to view my profile it said cannot few information i tried to join her pot but it did not show up for her she is ar fifty four and i am ar four if you know how to fix it please help
1,it took mins to download but when i got in most literaly it took four hours to load and then it crashed it crashed i had to do it all again
4,i love the game but i still cannot figure out how to dive i want to be able to interact with friends more
5,awsome game with with awsome story and gameplay definitely worth your time
5,love the game but the storage is a issue four is my last update my android is almost defeated i have played since but the storage is insane for phones please do something about this
1,the luck system is bs even when you spend money it is still rigged i have only gotten what i wanted times out of the or four times i have pulled it gets boring after a few months of playing and as far as the primogems bs goes they are not only overpriced but the game itself is not generous at all it gives you daily quests for sixty a day and they get very repetitive and very boring fast generally the game is very stingy with giving them out for free given the pity needed to get characters
4,put it on xbox already it is hard to play on a small phone thus it is hard to play for a long time without getting irritated especially when the phone graphics go in and out
4,this game is very fun and i love it the only rhing stopping me from giving it four stars is not being sble to skip dialog otherwise the battles the characters and everything is wonderful
5,the game and gameplay is great and i just noclipped to the wall unexpectedly idk why but i have pictures of it
5,what a graphics man just u need a good processor and you will love it very good game
5,game was masterpiece story good gamplay solid ten out of ten and events and quest are best part of this game and exploration are fun
5,it is a very impressive game and have a very good graphics and the gameplay is also good
5,a best graphics game that i try and i am shock me to see this graphics it is a very beautiful game and i just love it
5,amazing game and free roam is the best part and the graphic is super good
5,the graphic are incredible and the gameplay experience is really nice with the story line
5,the game is a great game but there is one thing can you please make it possible to download all the data straight to a sd card
4,from my experience it is a pretty good rpg game plus it is an open world rpg lastly the graphics are decent so il give it four star rating
5,amazing i downloaded the game to try it once and delete it but i ended up really liking it now i am addicted
4,this game is amazing but a bit hard when you first get it not glitching at all its a very fun game
5,this game is so good it makes me want to dance for primogems if you just want a game that is fun and will never delete then this is the game for you
5,has great grapichs and great content definitely recommend playing if you want a open world adventure
5,finally a mmorpg kind game where there is no autoplay button and you have to actually play
5,genshin impact is the best game ever especially when gliding around with the glider
5,awsome game but we need to fix the whole resource downloading thing most of the time it took to long also great game ten over ten
5,more places to teleport from all places because it makes my journey easier to complete the mission
5,amazing game just love it beautiful story lines awesome graphics and audio
5,such beautiful breathtaking scenery engaging quests that have amazing lore input and i love the plot twists
5,bummed that i cannot use my mobile gaming controller but other than that it is pretty awesome
5,i feel i am in isekai whats more it is the best rpg game ever i suggest everyone to play basically anime lovers who likes to watch isekai anime
3,i definitely like this game but the thing is if you are ah f two p players it is gonna be hell to you if you are planning to get a super strong character in the gacha i already draw eight times ten all i got is all four star weapon idid not even manage to get a five star character it is like gacha is rigged
4,have not played games on my phone for many years because i have not found any good ones this game just changed that
5,one of the best games so far everything one expects from an adventure game is present
5,i started playing this year and i seriously love the game it is a very unique set of work if you ask me
4,i wished the pitty system wasnt so unforgiving and dialogue skip doesnt exist wich makes it worse
1,give controller support to android i have started then instantly stopped playing
4,have not played for long really fun wish there are harder bosses to fight
5,great game with lots of story just a little resource intensive
5,this is amazing especially about how the terrain is so huge and you can go anywhere
5,i really like this game about this adventure and roleplay but there is a problem its take to much time to dowload but i dont care about this
5,this game is so awesome the characters and the voice lines but sometimes the npc talk to much
5,it was a good game but please make a button to skip their talking very talkative character
1,will not open i have cleared all the data i can and it still will not install the information so i am deleting this game
1,i have been waiting for years for controller support in this android game when will the controller support be available
1,please no more acsension quests it is way too hard now either put the rd one to recommended level seventy or no ruin guards or i quit
5,it is a best game but i have only one problem is with ms of this game is worst please fix this in the up coming update please but now i am giving it five star
1,it is difficult to make a passwords and username because it always says error
5,the best game ever and it is a wish based game and it works on anything also yelan and scaramoche are the best charaters
3,in my samsung a fifty four five g why playstation controller did not detect i want to play using controller let the andriod player using controller in this game it is hard to program controller support my god
5,this game is so high graphic game in the world but the story is so boring and in another game the story is not so long
5,it is awesome game i had ever played the graphics are so smooth it is like i am playing a real game i really liked this game
5,loving the art style smooth graphics good lore and very impressive va
5,add more endgame content combat improve the qol and fix spiral abyss and future characters for example add mobius from hi add more greenlike snake add mobius
1,an i supposed to wait through the first cutsean because i cannot make an account it only says login to an account for this reason and probably no help i gave this game a star review
1,years later this game still got no controller support while ios already got four months after the game released at this moment might as well google deleted this game from this store because it does not caters to the demographic android users
1,i hate your game certain abilities would not work and my delicious goulash i made after the boar king quest to keep warm in dragonspine mountains did not work my characters still froze to death and i tried to get hoyoverse to help me out but they would not help or even care your game is the worst most non fun rpg i ever played you game company should never ever receive any good reviews nor funding
1,the auto camera suck bad they did better with lag but i had to use all lowest graphic
5,this game is so good i love it but why it takes so long to open every update i want to play can genshin impact makes the five star comes faster there is people who do about one hundred pull for only one five star character but the character in the banner like ganyu xiao venti eula yea miko and raiden thank you for reading this and i wish if genshin impact player see the same and thank you again for genshin impact
5,its really good the character the story quest its all impressive
3,game is fantastic but game is not fully launch means story and game size is thirty gb plus very high for normal mobile user
5,literally my favorite game that i have ever played on a mobile device hands down the developers really outdid themselves with this particular masterpiece

5,it is a cool game but needs flagship lvl phones to play smoothly which i do not have but still good to play in my not so good phone
1,honestly its just a gyatt game too much skibidi toilet references and the new cameraman they added was trash including all the others from skibidi verse delete this game now its not worth the fanum tax

5,very good characters but im having trouble earning some heros wits for my characters but still solid five
2,it is always stuck on checking update after upgrade version damn
1,the latest events are all very bad and boring especially the samples event many players did not know it was a daily event
5,if you just want to enjoy adventuring and exploring in your own world then this game is for you
5,female character design could use some work but love everything else about it i do wanna kms infront of hoyo hq for the emotional turmoil four point two aq put me through tho ten over ten
5,best game so far best graphics best story and guest just loved it mostly after the version four just
5,after the four i would have said that this is the absolute peak of archon quest hoyoverse have done that alone deserve five star in my opinion
4,great game four but would be five if have controller support for mobile
1,after so many years they still cannot be bothered to add controller support ridiculous
4,it is amazing the graphics and everything but too much space

5,best graphics and nice adventure story and the character is sow awesome love this game star star star star star
3,i cannot get into the game because it keeps on saying that it has insufficient storage space but it does not
5,the game is great the problem is the memory issue cause files is way to big
5,it is a beautiful game in fact but the amount of space it takes is ridiculously huge but if that does not bother you greatly recommend
5,i love it but could there be a new update of hoyoverse allowing data to be shared across servers thank hoyoverse for the game genshin

5,optimize the game performance and stability
5,i love the story am at rank eight even though i downloaded it today
1,the spanish translation is horribly vulgar full of misspellings and grammar mistakes
5,i just absolutely loved the game and their is most probably no problems i have been faced with till now such an impressive game
5,this game is so fun especially since you can play with friends which makes it even more fun
5,it is an amazing game but hoyoverse and genshin bless me with great luck using wishes
5,genshin impact is the best game i have ever played it can be better if they give us more primogems
3,it is so hard to win and all of my wishes are always hard pity
4,i love this game but there is a problem with me the game is little bugging can u please please please fix it
3,to big of a game on mobile its like six gb for me it takes up alot of storage on my phone otherwise this game would be a four

5,the graphics are very good even in mobile i am rlly impressed
1,i download this game resources which is eight five gbs after all my data and time waste it is going to download again whole eight five gbs again
3,it was really slow to download everything but overall seems like a great game
5,awesome graphics gameplay and storyline
5,amazing story and game play i love the details on everything
4,on a plus side the games a great combination of xenoblade and botw on the bad side is that it is a combination of xenoblade and botw
5,absolutely love it it may be a bit frustrating but it is worth it
5,playstation is better then cell phone but at least i can play anywhere i am at so it is good
2,it my system ui keeps crashing i just want to know whats happening
3,this game is very fun and i enjoyed it for awhile but after a while it just got boring i do not know if this is just me
5,nice graphics and also the story of the game is so marvelous
2,add controller support with the backbone controller
4,pretty good game has definitely evolved over the years been playing yr and i all was come back to it
4,good game and lore and all but i just met diluc and my game keeps freezing and im so upset edit nvm i restarted my phone and it works again edit the game is too laggy to even begin to play
5,amazing game i would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fond of open world games with a story to follow
4,graphics characters and game mechanics perfect but pulling a character is so hard and its so hard to earn primo gems
3,phone slow phone cramped pity rates and resources to get a five star are lower than the abyss love getting those star weapons also top up prices for the resources they give is depressing but since it is a gacha it is perfectly fine right welkin moon is your only friend if you want to use money efficiently on this game five for almost the same amount of primos as the fifty dollar top up without the first time bonus only downside is that it takes a month to get those primos
4,so far i love the game the only thing i do not love is the moving control it can become frustrating at times
4,takes long to load but otherwise it was great very fun and a lot of details
5,out of the world exp made for us who long for vacation but stuck in our desk love the graphic and you can just see the dedication in every detail of the game superb
4,well i just played genshin about four month and already takes nine gb on my phone but overall the game is good i liked the storys and i liked the quests but sadly it tajes alot of memory
3,it keeps saying something is wrong and nothing is wrong with the game it will not let me play anymore please fix this
4,it is a great game but it takes too much storage from our gadget is there a way you could fix the storage issues not hating but it just takes too much storage it would not even download since i only have five gb storage left even though i deleted all of my apps so i hope you could lessen the gb that the game needs
1,unplayable on phone it kicks me out every few minute even if i have enough storage it kicked me out right now in fact i barely finished one commission it is more suitable for pc or laptop
2,i give a stars because when i play it i do not have enough storage i think i do can you please fix it and i when i keep playing it keep saying i do not have a storage
4,i am giving it fours for now it is a really great game it keeps me occupied for hours but my only concern is it is lagging i do not know why though can you pls fix it i hope you could read my concern tnx in advance btw i hope u add log in rewards too much gb i will be back to play again when i upgrade my phone i will miss you genshin i will be back wait for meee
5,very free to play friendly game because the gacha has a guarantee system sure money can buy progress but not necessarily important
5,i am happy one of genre that i like so i enjoy the game of course is consuming a lot of time but it is my choice
5,had playing this game for years and nine months straight n everyday why because i love this game so much this game have beautiful graphic and wonderful ost first gacha games i ever played and i very satisfied with all the characters i hope i can get all characters in fontaine
3,this game is great i used to play it all the time and i got really far but im not able to play it anymore because there is not enough space on my phone no matter how much i uninstall or delete off my phone which really sucks so because of that it is a stars for me
4,good game very nice the characters are well designed but will not give me qiqi it is either i win the pity or get another character that is five star but no qiqi i demand a qiqi
3,i usually play this when i am bored but there is things that bother me here first is as someone who picked lumine as my mc it is kinda sad that she is barely in any official arts i know aether might be the canon protagonist but i am pretty sure putting lumine in one official art will not hurt second the game gets boring after having quests that only give thirty to sixty primogems even after hours of work though aside from those this is a nice game and the character designs and personalities are cool
5,i love it it is so creative and fun and it makes you excited to wish for other characters
3,i suggest that there should be a menu wherein we can resize the joypad in phone because its too small sometimes i accidentally press attack instead of dash
3,the game in general is great the graphics and maps are awesome but the resin system is awful the cap in sixty is so fast and cant acumulate any further that the limit
4,really fun game but i always get nothing on the summons but it is still a good game nine over ten would recommend
5,best open world experience i have not found in any other game and characters are fantastic to play with hangout events and story quests also give many funny and delightful moments throughout the game though i do not have any five star character so far
5,best adventure open world game ever i hope this game keep getting updates
3,i am really upset this game was absolutely amazing before but now when i try and open it it keeps telling me that i have insufficient storage space even though i am clearing the data and cache i have even tried uninstalling it twice but still no luck i do not know what to do
5,really good the lore the characters even the enemies but i gotta learn how to build my chars hehe
4,thank you for bringing forty five fps option to mobile i wonder when the developers add official gamepad or keyboard option to mobile if you guys did that it will be fun for us mobile player maximize the gameplay
3,in serenitea we have a bed furniture but there is no action sleep why we should have a bed if we cannot sleep on it plaese if there is an action to sit on a chair i wish there is also an action to sleep on a bed and we animals in our serenitea but we please make an action to pet them or feed them please make it controller support for android phone i wanna play this game with my gamepad
5,once it is downloaded u can play it like a madman for hours without any moneyoptional i love this game the most that almost nineeight items are free in this game
1,been playing this games for years and now i cannot even play anymore i have friends with the newest iphone who cannot even download this game because of how much storage it takes ive deleted literally everything off my phone and still cant even download much less run it you need to fix your game
4,a great story playing game but it lacks some optimisation on xiaomi pad six even though this tab is powered by sd eightseventy the game looks pixelated on some areas while fighting on max graphics and i can feel minor jitters then and there but overall it is a mind blowing game for sure
5,this game is soo amazing traveling everywhere and the scenery is soo calming and i felt like i was in the game i feel soo inspired
4,everythings gonna be good in this game but they need listen to gamers and add east languages like arabic
5,i love this game i have been playing it for almost years and i am not planning to stop now the storyline is nothing but exceptional from the start especially the inazuma and sumeru regions if you start playing this because of the good reviews i assure you that this will be one of the best games you have played
5,very good game their were some glitches but overall very good
1,got worst acc ever bad artifact up to ninety nine percent and guaranted one hundred percent high pity and lose every single banner ascend and talent got so minimum nothing any good at my account
5,the best open world game i have ever played amazing story very very good graphics good gameplay but network is the only problem you should download this game if you want to play the best open world game in the world
5,in fact the game is amazing is one of my favorites games can wait for the realease of furina overall the quest lore gaming experience feels amazing best game so far
3,i cannot access the battle pass menu since i updated it any solution for this thank you
5,after spending nine thousand hours i finnally got the character i dont want i reccomend this game
4,i love this game but so i give a good rating but i did not log in for a couple weeks and when i went back on it restarted my whole game i was and still so sad and upset i would really like to get my account back cause i tried to log in it said account does not exist plz help plz bro yall update i got my account back a long time ago hoyoverse is really decated to costumer service so if something like this happens to you i would contact them and it gets fixed within a few days
5,i love this game but i needed to download it again but it told me no storage while i have enough storage for it please fix your problem i really want to play the new fontaine archon quest like please fix this problem somehow like quick i am begging
5,ngl i found this game off of a cute fan made pic of venti and started to get more interestd so i decided to download the game and it is so much fun there is a lot to do the only thing is it is hard to complete some of the stuff on mobile than it is on pc and stuff but other than that ten ove ten recommended
5,a wonderful game i admire the characters and their designs and the storyline is just great
4,they added a new region and some great quality of life upgrades we finials have proper maps
1,i let the game run figuring it was downloading the content all i was seeing was a floating walkway in front of me taking me to some building like roman through clouds hrs and it was still on the walkway no game what so ever i think if they fix it the graphics was amazing so i give it a one star great looking walk way but hope that not all you expect people to do in the game is listen to good music and meditate down a path that never ends
5,really good over a experience and story lines my personal favourite part is characters and team building so many combinations and synergies would like to see more frequent events and other sources for primogems and resin
2,having issues with the game today as the buttons are not working cannot use the fighting moves nor speed run up the cliff was working fine this morning but out of nowhere it was doing that
5,best game great arts style thoughtful gameplay very thought out
5,this game rus smoothly on my device it has no errors or bugs in it this is a great game
5,great open world game i like the style and look dev of the game really enjoying it
1,i used to love the game but the sumeru area lags terribly and i have a rog phone six gaming phone please fix this
3,love this game but my hands cannot handle the game play on my phone i am an android user can we please update the system to allow android users to have the ability to use controllers please i went and bought a controller so i could play this game more
3,it is kinda fun but maybe if i had a better device it would be better plus i do not like that i have to delete everything just to play the game but other than that it is ok just not for me
5,i used to hate genshin back then in twenty twenty but then i interested and liked it because my friend played it the game is well done and the graphics is quite good but compared to my honkai star rail and genshin my honkai star rail is more lagger than my genshin awesome game keep it up to update game like this hoyoverse
4,love the improvement especially on fontaine made alot of free to play wishes bc of it hope this also applies to natlan
5,i will admit i was a little reluctant to give this game a try thinking that it was all show and not tell but i am actually having a blast playing this game i only downloaded it yesterday and it already got me hooked if only they made a version to play on nintendo switch i would be set for life
5,i have not showered for a month did not touch grass since i started playing i have no friends and my parents do not love me anymore but this game is awesome and i highly recommend
4,the storage space is not my problem but it still laggy in eight gb phone in medium settings overall the story is so cool i would still recommend this
5,really fun game amazing animation and drawn d scenes that come rarely the voice actors are great and barely any ads this game is really fun i highly recommend it
5,youll probably never see a better free open world the gameplay is really relaxing a lot of content story can be quite interesting and heartwarming the problem is with the rng grinding the same domain for couple of months for good character builds can be quite annoying you also have no guarante youll be able to get something good also the creators hardly ever listen to the community we keep asking for increase in resin cap for like years even forty resin more would be great but they say no
4,love the game but please for the love of barbirtos can we have the option of unlinking our accounts from our psn accounts withouth losing our progress also please make an option to block requests if wanted
5,i really like this game but my only problem is that it takes up a loooooot of storage four gb but other than that its a great game with great graphics coding lore and has a very large continuosly growing open world my only wish is that it had pvp and took up less storage
5,this game is so good and even me and my brother nor cousin loves to play and used to top up more because of this game the anniversary is near i hope you guys give us more reward and more events or likes five star standard characters i am kidding it depends on you guys this game teach me how to earn how to save and also love your family this game taught me how to cooperate and how to be sociable i just want to thank this game my life has changes alot because of you guys ily all
4,honestly i played the game so much even though it lags my phone since it is a large game i still get past it also the no ads and no need for paying just i am so grateful the only problem i have is how long it takes to upgrade your adventure levels since there are no specific things to do as a starter player to hurry it up i think it is handled a bit better in star rail
5,i really in love with this game its cool game full of adventure and fighting even though that is my type
3,great game and everything but actually it is too big for a phone game pc version is enough for me
1,this is very good game but size is very long i am not tary it but i see in a youtube that is a very high grafith game please size doing a samll size
5,genshin impact a really great open world game with many characters and story i really like it the characters are cool with their great skills and also the amazing story behind them the map is so big you will never get tired of exploring it adventuring finding treasures the graphics are great with many different terrain in different places i really love it please continue to make it more interesting for us travelers
5,i like this game there are many things you can do it is not boring you can play with friends 🇸🇩
5,good game but make sure you pack a lunch top tier game and takes the memory for it
5,fun phone gets hot though i have a cheap phone too but graphics are great physics are sound
4,well it is a fun game i never played open world game before and the fontaine map it is cool the players can swim now
5,super nice game i have had some problems like lagging so much that it kicks me out but overall the game is awesome there are plenty of characters to choose from areas events extra recommend for those who like offline but you can play online as well when you want to help with worlds quests but not everything
1,seven update like u asked i would not give it star i uninstalled it waited then checked my data and storage i have plenty so there is no reason after i connect to of ways and agree to the terms privacy that it should not finish but it does not i took a screenshot of the error but there is not a way to upload it here original review basically from the time i downloaded it it keeps saying there isnt enough room to do the updates i have five gb left so how is that not enough room
1,the game does not open after the new update version four the screen stays white after opening the door and says that i am disconeccted
5,i just wanted to say that i really love playing this game and i enjoyed everything about it for the past two years this might be the last day i played this game because my phone cannot handle it anymore and i cannot also do the quest because it crashes and freezes i hope someday i can play this game again if ever i have a better devices and free time i wanted to say thank you genshin and hoyoverse for creating this wonderful game i will never forget the happy memories you gave to me thank you
5,good optimisied performance highly recommended for anyone who wants to pass their time playing a fun rpg
4,i love this game the graphics the character everything but please add skip button for story and please put more effort in other than main quest add voices to the npc and character during quest lastly please make shanhe rerun banner
5,the game is aweasome playable for free no ads can pay to win more and better characters totally optional the game is gb absolutely worth any money you want to put in
4,i like this game there are many things you can do it is not boring you can play with friends
5,i have been playing since almost the start of this year and i am already in love with it the character design the events the quests the downside is that it takes a lot of storage
5,love the app amazing charecters and storyline the regions and landscape is also breathtaking
2,its an okay game but it takes thirty gb of storage already and wants me to free up eight gb for their new update the storage has been an issue for a while and so many people have stopped playing because its not worth the storage and annoyance
5,still the best game i have played so far so much adventures and playing it makes me really forget about the time there is some features i wish the developers would consider making tho i wish there were some monsters which can be tamed and be pets and will accompany and help the character thru fights also monsters which can be mounted would be nice given that sometimes the map is too big to be explored by foot that is it i hopenthe developers would consider this than you
3,it is a really great game and fun as well i have been playing for maybe a year already and i have not thought of quitting at all there is this issue though where i would wish and then in the middle of getting the rewards the game just exits when i open the app again i can neither get back my primogems nor get at least what was already shown for me to recieve happened twice already but only recorded the second time i also checked history and it is just as my gems vanished into thin air
5,the graphic is soooo cool there is a lot of cool characters and then i met my soulmate at fontaine called the hydro archon focalors
5,best game ever ten over one thousand story lines effects and whole map is great so much addictive game i played for seven hours in the first day
5,one of my favourite games i can easily say that i will be sticking with it till the last update and beyond the controls and features are quick to learn making this a great game for new players the character design and open world are some of my favourite things it is difficult to run out of things to do in genshin it would be great if it could be made more friendly for mobile players as the size is quite large
4,my luck in gacha game is actually bad but the game is actually good and has a nice music and the world exploration which is really good
5,i love the open world experiences the graphics and design is breathtaking
5,this game is too good to be true i love this game i thought it was a stupid game at first but now i know it is the most coolest game i have ever played before thank you so much not only that the graphics are awesome love ya hoyoverse
1,add the game to xbox and add controller support to android you are gate keeping a good game
5,it is the most beautiful game and the graphics are awesome whats better is paimon she was here from the start and been by my side
5,awesome great graphics awesome game play cool story and awsome people in game so five out of five a alikyte among diamonds
5,great game been playing for yrs since i said great game lol they send birthday cakes and fireworks in game lol play story mode and grind or upgrade beautiful game great mechanics and the details keep you looking and forgetting youre busy i found myself farming by accident in the beginning now i have to remember to farm lol
5,just a great game only if your prepared to empty your wallet every once in a while to get the character and or skin you want and as people say the game gets bigger and bigger and some people just do not have five five giga bites of space visuals are awesome but every couple hours you will crash at some point between ar twenty to forty it gets very difficult to lvl up and the quests stack on but i have no problem with that
4,it is nice but it can get hard and a bit boring but do new quests its really fun have not played in a bit but i will post about the update
5,i love this game so much it is really fun and interesting the characters have wonderful design
5,it is a good game the only cash i can get is it is very difficult to get five star characters but thanks again to the studio that made this game
5,really good game i like the graphics and the fps is nice as long you have a strong processor that is
3,no controller support for android ios has controller support while androids have been neglected there is even a key binding option for controllers that is blank because androids cannot play genshin with controllers i will give this game five stars once an update reveals that androids have controller support
5,add skip bottom story so longgg for hours i just wanna explore scenery not being stuck for hours doing a h quest for just half a wish
1,couldnt even play it because it said i needed more space even after uninstalling my biggest app
2,too much grind unlike other gacha games still no controller support
4,ill give genshin a four star its a good game if you dont have anything to do its a time consuming game but only if you have lots of storage if your on mobile your genshin probably will lag a bit or just put it on the lowest graphic as a genshin player that plays genshin over a year started on seven its a veryyy time consuming game but only on the early gameplay it will become a boring game when you reached a high ar like ar fifty seven or so well if your ar sixty you basically just wait for events
5,my experience is magical with the graphics and the characters most times the characters talk for a long time but i am impatient over all it is a wonderful game to play
4,i founds this game very enjoyable and barely any glitches however my only complaint is that it took way too long to download resources and data apart from that minor part everything else is really good
2,couldnt register using email address it really forcing you to use either google facebook or twitter to register i do not have facebook or twitter account and i definitely not going to use my google account to register until this issue fixed stars for this game period
4,yes the game has its issues but its better than most in this genre
5,a really good game but getting the characters that you want without paying is very hard
4,the game is really addictive and also i really like it especially when you get to fight enemies but there is not really much to do just have to do quest did not really get to fight but it is fun either way
5,please make it more compatible for mobile users it is getting more and more lagging after ever update
5,i love this game the character design are so good the graphics and everything
5,immersive after sevenmo i still love it wish the rng was a little more favorable but who does not update new check out a genshin getting started guide so you do not fall victim to early account mistakes a good beginner guide should cover all the basics and prepare you for upcoming endeavors
5,amazing graphics and amazing story
4,this game being free is an absolute win the scenery and graphics are absolute the music is so hype and chilling the stories are chefs kiss and the prizes on events are generous i just hope there is more late game contents for those player who are only waiting for the next story before every patch
4,game is good scenery storyline events and many things are pretty but now as fontaine update came my devices cannot seem to handle laggy game also fixing to reduce storage would be good for many players to join hoyoverse please fix laggy issues in fontaine it is terrible
1,a bad game and it needs a big space and waste of time i hope no one will play this awful.
5,abyss is too hard the boss couple is too powerful all stage are difficult event is difficult and reward are low i lose my fifty on furina after all my efforts new event is good
5,everything is good characters world the areas the quests and the best thing is that it is an open world and you can go anywhere if i could i would rate the game six stars
2,great game but bad qol lack of feature and boring repetitive grind fest of artifact the artifact always have bad stat on my account atleast give us an option to skip the domain or sweep the domain and can use multiple resin condensed resin is outdated system for example aether gazer can use multiple swig in x run devs is too lazy to update the game and listen to community please listen to your large base of community there is a lot of complain and player burnout
1,i had to download twenty gb to run the game and on my five g wifi it still took me two days i came back after a while and it said sixteen gb bruhhhh i get three hundred mb update but one hundred sixty eight b the entire game was a gig it is a big open world with good graphics so i get twenty gb but why do you have to download sixteen gb more same world same story an update should three hundred mb to sixty mb gb if it is big but sixteen gb now the game is thirty seven gb and not only did i have to download it but my phone is almost full not to mention the lag even though i have five g
5,i will give it a five because i like how you can go anywhere you want and how the characters look but it is too much storage
4,really amazing open world game it is really interesting and detailed even going as far as giving mobs great background stories unfortunately after the latter half of the patch the game has been lagging so much looking like a stop motion picture production and taking too long to open even the paimon menu this led to me not being able to play properly and ultimately losing interest in playing the game i hope to be able to play the game with ease when i can afford a better phone
5,awesome game with cool story and animations and open world i have not lost a single yet
1,it has been years since this game has released and there is no android controller support and while their other games have support
1,the puzzles in inazuma does not make sense and you have to follow walkthroughs on youtube step by step to complete them finally reduced another star even genshin content creators struggle to star the current abyss if you are free to play stay away from spiral abyss it is a trap that majority of even paying players cannot finish just enjoy the story reduced another stars cannot do any quests because the quest location is involved with other locations i am this close to uninstalling honestly
5,once you get past all of the instructions it is a really fun games
4,ok iove the game just had to uninstall it due to the amount of space it took up does it have to take up so much space i think it was all ready over twenty gb by the time i uninstalled it and i just cannot seem to get the hang of fighting also keep getting jumped by stronger enemies when exploring and dieing to them but overall the game is really good
5,such a beautiful world building such a nice gameplay such an incredible story placed in a fantasy world love enjoying this game
5,this game has had me hooked on it for so long the only reason why i been unable to download it is because of the gigantic download size but this was way worth the wait in my opinion i have to sadly give up on this game as it has made so even if i unistall i still cannot fix it so i have to unistall the game but in my mind it is still a ten over ten game
4,i love this but the only problem i have is that i am quite new to the game and i want to get cyno but to ascend him you need scarabs but i do not have the areas unlocked on the map so i cannot even see where the area is please make and easier way to get them for newer players
4,it is actually a five star for me but i decided to give it only four since i was disappointed because it does not support controller for android it will be much better to play this game with the help of the controller regardless of what device but overall it is still a good game
5,amazing cool story amazing graphics problem it is so boring when you have to stop half way through a story to level up your character to continue
5,i love everything about this music graphics characters everything it is beautiful and the experience is great to explain in single line this is a better than expected game
5,my parents hate me for playing this but i still do its a really good game with great character design and good music you also never get bored because it is constantly gives you things to do i really like it overall it has great open world experience
1,after of my updating of this fame its almost unplayable in dimensity one thousand one hundred and eight gb of ram even i look in the sky which is not part of rendering its seems its running at thirty fps below of that please trace the performance issue of this game asap also of taking not even in lowest setting its not helping well seems this game does a frame capping issue
5,it is good for most of the game play but there has been bugs and glitches when doing certain storys overall everything else is not so bad
5,when first looked at this thinking cool only hundred megs to download seven gigs on mobile device well worth it open world like for mobile is a bonus keep up good work devs
1,trash game with rigged luck do not start playing if you are interested in the characters just watch clips of them on youtube not like you are ever going to roll the one you want also do not bother contacting support because in years of playing they have literally never helped on a request even once
4,it is overall a pretty good game but there are two things one it takes alot of space just to run the game in general i know its so the graphics are better and such i just feel it is abit excessive and second the ads the way they advertise the game in general is so just obnoxious and even abit annoying the game does not have ads in game i am just talking about the advertising of the game on other platforms overall great game
3,love the game but getting wishes is so hard the events give you little primos so does the quests
5,perfect game for those who wants to explore and story is decent for most the people but overall i can say story is well maintained background song fights boses and archons gods are just so amazing that is why it is been over a year and i am still playing it
5,super amazing graphics this game has amazing quality plus you do not have to purchase anything unless you want to be extra edit although some of the loading can take a while especially the first second loading it is worth it the graphics and sound effects are incredible edit i cant play anymore because of insufficient storage space i have deleted so much stuff but still not enough i ended up deleting the app but will attempt to re download it with my new phone hope it works
4,pretty good i have only played the intro but its very smooth and the controls are pretty good there were a few audio glitches where there was static sound and a few cutscenes froze up but i am sure these bugs will be patched out i also wish there was an option to rescale some of the buttons as the buttons on the top of the screen are just way too small it would also be nice if the controls supported gyroscope aiming especially for the bow otherwise though i have really enjoyed it
4,the game is amazing beautiful graphics cool characters and a great story i do have some problems though i feel it is too much because i have to play with a charger plugged in and it still loses battery the cutscenes freeze no matter what quality i am on my biggest problem in game is the adventure rank leveling up it takes hours to level it up just one level and the ratio between the amount you get from doing things is a little off
5,great game do not be fooled or dissuaded by the breath of the wild comparisons it is an open world action rpg alright but it is got its own flair as well the characters elemental system and overworld are so detailed the controls and camera can be improved definitely but they are not game breaking just inconvenient sometimes also some of the voice lines compared to the captions are entirely different from each other which kind of breaks immersion overall definitely worth it
5,overall really good and fun game the graphics are amazing the game can get really laggy at random times though i also had a lot of problems when first downloading it it either kept failing or would glitch out and restart the download for the rest of the content it was really frustrating but i really wanted to play so i kept trying i feel like if you werent dedicated to wanting to play the game then the download at the start would be a huge deterrent as well as the lagging during game play
4,meticulously crafted and lovingly created the cast has unique characters even if you do not roll gacha the controls are a little harder on mobile as opposed to pc i play both but that is on account of my own dexterity everything is easy to pick up and learn and the open world is gorgeous i love climbing mountains and just staring at scenery after almost half a year the end game is repetitive and there is not much to do you can still appreciate the wonderful scenery and the amazing music
4,fun story and interesting game play controls are a bit awkward especially trying to change your view and move while fighting an enemy also very difficult to make precise movements and trying to pick up stuff while running takes some practice for sure other than the touchscreen controls i am very impressed you can tell this game was developed more for console gaming and then adapted for phones the slight frustration of the controls is worth getting to play it though
4,great i love it i love how intuitive the element system is the great artstyle and music and the exploration is perfect i did have some gripes about the preformance there are some issues during cutscenes and frames can drop during fights i also have a lot of connection issues as i reconnect often although i do not know if that is simply an issue on my end or with the game my last issue is the game is it is limited in platform choice as i am unable to get this game on my tablet four five
5,great game so far just a few things that can be improved on the graphics and story are amazing there are some things that can be improved on like some quality of life changes and also the cutscene the cutscene frezzes during a few transitions and in the midlle for a few seconds and the voices also glitch a bit should be worth looking into other than that it is a great game
1,great game would give five if it had controller support on android
4,i almost never rate my apps but games like this is exeptional and if anyone is wondering whether or not it is worth the phone storage it takes up the answer is yes i did however encounter a slight glitch in the intro story animation where the audio and images were breaking up but it did not last the controls are smooth and the environment you can interact with are surprisingly many i cant even imagine the kind of work that was put into this to achieve this level of detail love the art
5,this is one of the most beautiful and in depth games ive ever played on a mobile device i love how deep and rich it is i love the open world i love the game play style and combat systems my only suggestion would be the option to adjust the onscreen controls i find myself pushing the wrong buttons or attacking when i just want to adjust my camera
4,cannot get past loading screen update i figured out that you can get past only if you login in the first screen it is bad design as they allow you to close the login screen which makes it seem like optional if you close it though the next screen just hangs without an indication of what went wrong after playing the game a bit i can say that this seems like a promising game pretty much everything i saw was similar to zelda breath of the wild which is a venerable game
4,it is a wonderful game the graphics visuals audio play characters and plot are all done very well as expected however i do not recommend playing this on mobile ironically as even my phone couldnt handle it and ended up ruining the gaming experience for me playing on pc seems to be a more desirable option though i doubt i can get this game free on pc i can only say this much from what i have seen and experienced in the start more or less hope to play it again in a more suitable condition
4,the gameplay and the story are truly amazing i only have problems with the game not big problems but if they could be looked at or fixed this game could get more downloads than it does at the moment first problem the controls are a bit too close to each other i often find myself hitting the slash button when climbing or simply just moving the screen around last problem if the game could be optimised a bit for low end devices so that it could run more smoothly it would be epic
4,ngl the game is amazing the graphics and the story is awesome hadnt played the game in a while came back the audio was weird it has a odd static robot sound as if the voices were distant or you have headphones plugged in partially i did delete it a few months ago and recently reinstalled it in the beginning of the tutorial the motion was quite chopy but that soon went away and has yet to come back continuing to play the sound slowly gets better for full cutscenes the sound is fine
4,it is a great game but i am only giving it four stars the game is very open great characters storyline is awesome hints of romance etc my only problems are some quests are very annoying to complete because it dosnt actually show you where to go and it gets frustrating so maybe more hints would be nice my biggest issue is the adventure rank as i said it is a great game with lots to do but the adventure rank leveling gets very tedious and annoying please fix it thanks d
5,this game is amazing i am just gonna get this out of the way from the simple controls to the cutscenes to the characters i love every single one of them yet the game is not perfect i found a glitch where i got stuck in the climbing position on a building and couldnt get down and i play on a google pixel xl and the audio seems to glitches and is choppy some of the time overall this is an amazing game and i highly recommend it it is more of a bigger app around eight gb still very worth it
4,game is very fun and graphics are gorgeous wish it was easier to get the currency for the gatchas by gathering but i understand that is how they are making money since the game is free otherwise controls on the phone are a bit awkward i feel the touch joystick is too far towards the center of the screen if it was the floating style that centered where you touched the screen in the bottom left corner it would be better i mainly play this on pc anyways so not a huge deal for me
4,the game is really fun and flashy but the speed at which you earn premium currency is extremely slow as well as it being overpriced if you buy it with real money but i never feel i need to spend money to progress as it only unlocks new characters to play as so i am not that upset as for how the app runs on mobile is a different question i have a note eight imo thats a pretty new device unfortunately the game crashes often and constantly suffers from frame rate drops and performance issues
2,it deserves five stars for the first thirty levels but about every system and event that is build in is absolute garbage it makes it very hard to play it on a daily basis as that is not what the game feels like it makes you feel like you want to get lost in it but then it just starts to limit about every single thing you would want to do like flying before noticing suddenly you cant anymore very dissapointing
5,my journey so far in the game has been amazing graphics and controls are great system is easy to understand for now my only complaints is that the game suddenly stops at random times and kicks me out to the phones home screen i do not know if its maybe related to the log in options or something else so i will be glad if this can be fixed i will update this peace of text if problems are still there edit never mind it was just the server getting overloaded with new players downloading
3,the game is great i find it to be really fun the characters have a good background story the graphics are excellent soundtracks on point and co op gaming makes things even better but in terms of in game purchases prices are absolutely ridiculous for countrys such as brazil i strongly believe they should make adaptations to the shop depending on the regions reality and considering as how i have seen other comments abording the same subject i hope this changes
4,the graphics is good and the quality of the game is really great and i would really love to play this game the developers really did a great job for this the only problem is it is unplayable in mobile devices with gb ram whenever i interact with the npcs it just crashes still i managed to get to the secrete pirate treasure quest but that is where my journey ended this game is really great and i still hope that the developers can find a way to fix the problem
4,it is great the storylines are great the graphics well done and the characters are well designed the problem i currently have with this is just the fact that i had my graphics set to the lowest setting it still lags in frustration i set it to highest and it still lags but at the same rate maybe even less hopefully you will be able to make this game more compatible with mobile one last thing please give more rewards after a really hard quest really annoying once you get to higher ranks
4,the game is very beautiful in its design and art the story is also interesting and i look forward to the tales that unfold in teyvat however there are a few problems with it despite being designed for phone it started to slowly slowly get stuck which forced me to uninstall the game and move to pc the characters were interesting in the start but recently they all feel like a remake of some old neglected characters with only a few changes and sometimes none
4,the game is great with bosses loot exploration quests and more but there is an issue this is where the game will be goingi can hear everything and press buttons after a scene or transaction but the loading screen is in the way so you cannot see anything then i have to restart which takes a while to restart if they can fix that bug it would be perfect especially for a new app other than that it is really great and i recommend it
5,first it is cross platformed it has a great way in letting people play with eachother because of the adaptability of it being able to support other devices the graphics are really great and so was the gameplay i like the storyline and voice acting it has many different playstyles you can do not just hunting down enemies so people can choose what they want to do lastly i really like how it is open world even though the mob difficulty spikes but just roaming around and exploring is great
4,the graphics are absolutely gorgeous the characters the voice acting the adventure storyline music everything is amazing the only reason why i rated it four stars was because of slight audio problems and glitching as well as camera problems my camera sometimes moves in one direction without me touching anything or the audio cuts out briefly regardless i highly recommend this game i play on mobile so it is a bit laggy but i am assuming that is normal you should definitely play
5,the game is excellent one of the best ones i have ever played for sure i do happen to have a recurrent issue since the two point zero update though at random times the game shuts and i have to restart the application and it is very annoying because it sometimes happens in the middle of a fight clearing cache usually fixes the problem but only for some time after a while the game crashes again genshin impact is the only application i have been experimenting this issue with any possible fixes
4,i would give this game five stars because of the picturesque sceneries cute and semi realistic animation cool fighting and exploring scenes etc but the rock climbing is so difficult that it takes me an hour to go to a certain place also the camera angle moves in the midst of fighting so it is kinda annoying that i cannot see anything but grass and stuffs but despite those problems i would definitely recommend this game
5,it is an incredible experience the visuals sounds and play are very beautiful and smooth thats even on some of the lowest settings the story line is well thought out and the characters are unique the combat system enforces the need to practice different tactics and character combos no oping through with a single one thank you for making this game free to play
5,the game is great the lore is deep the story is compelling the characters are relatable and the scenery is beautiful and the combat and upgrade systems work wonders this is a five star review almost perfect game but it is hefty in the requirements to run it i have a year old phone and it runs with lag on the lowest settings this game was clearly built for stronger devices like pcs consoles and select phones but it is a drawback i will accept as it is my fault for lack of resources
4,mobile version is not too great imo but the pc version is really good but mobile version it has lots of framerate issues even on really low settings and the touch controls feel awkward and are hard to use but this is definitely a platform problem i can play max settings fourk on my pc and the controls are super easy to use there i did not expect much from a free game but it delivers on what the ads promised unlike many other games from little known developers quite fun
4,i really love this game but be warned this game is huge im lucky i have space the characters are not bad and some are even charming in their own ways and the graphics are great i recommend turning them down a bit if your phone is not a beast though my only problem is the audio glitch i have been experiencing i have a note nine and it was running fine till the update the audio often will be distorted at random and it made me sad that i couldnt understand characters sometimes
5,absolutely beautiful game from the beginning this game will show you gorgeous character models environments and you have all the freedom to swim roam and climb as much as your stamina lets you the combat is pretty fun so far being a ranged class for example it is really smooth having the option to break into a sprint to get some space and have the choice to really aim your shots with a gyro aiming option to do some damage i genuinely cannot get over how pretty this mobile game is
4,the game has great graphics and a good sense of adventure wide variety of characters story wise it is fine nothing amazing i however dislike that the game is not very optimised or very efficient with the devices chipsetflagship included or is not designed to be as how easily it takes for my device to become a hand warmer during the winter no matter the setting if it was an hour through it would be understandable but it just takes a few minutes to heat up
5,voice and animation clips are great a good non auto rpg that players can explore the world and gain good items my only issue is that when you aim a target with a bow it is somewhat hard to center a target takes time to aim due to difficulty to control even if i set up the sensitivity option same as to run and walk i hope their is a mini shortcut that enables to run walk without overdoing the controls other than that it is a great game thanks for bringing it up
4,the overall story is good the effort is great but the graphics and overall performance is quite a bummer since i have started playing sound is quite choppy and nothing but black screen when i watch cut scenes i wish you would include some settings where we can remove unnecessary animations like grass movement water reflection and more
4,this game is amazing i personally love the art style not to mention the backstory of the characters is fairly interesting and the attention to detail from the trees moving when you run through them to what i have seen so far all the npcs having some form of dialoge about themselves or their situation my only issue is that their seems to be no way to remap controls i have not ran into a bug or error so cannot point that out in short amazing game
5,i have been addicted to this game ever since i started playing it the characters the stories and overall the concept of the game is really beautiful but i do have suggestion though there are times that i accidentally exit the app during or after a cutscene due to real life matters so when i open the game once again i have to repeat the whole cutscene again it would be a great help if cutscenes have a skip button so we can get straight to the point without repeating the whole scene again
3,pretty decent and loaded with content impressive graphics and a good benchmark for device performance no controller support is available and you are not able to adjust the onscreen controls since the control stick is fixed it is hard to maneuver when on narrow platforms or jumps and i have dive bombed so many times trying to move the camera around this makes getting through the tougher timed courses very difficult controller support or control customization is key to an improved review
5,everything is amazing i love the graphics the gameplay is run and intuitive and the controls are simple and easy to learn the only problem i have with the game is that i wish it had a auto pickup feature as having to stand near a dropped item for seconds is kind of tedious nonetheless great game this feature is mostly meant for the mobile version as rh pc version is fine as is
3,i wish i could report my issues but the cs button is inconveniently in game before i went on a break the game worked perfectly but after i came back and had to update it gets stuck on the white elements loading screen and rarely ever loads then it suddenly crashed out of nowhere in the middle of a battle i really want to keep playing genshin again these bugs are making it impossible for me to even play the game anymore reinstalling is not helping neither is reverifying the files
5,fun addicting and spectacular the storyline is gripping the worlds beautiful and the enemies varied the puzzles are awesome and they sometimes have unexpected solutions the soundtrack is just enchanting this is my favourite game ever i just wish it was easier to get characters and that the resin system was not in place that is honestly the worst thing about the game in my opinion however i still absolutely recommend you download it
5,an absolutely incredible feat of game development this game feels like what breath of the wild could have been if it were better it is a triple a gaming experience on android it is the most polished incredibly well designed game i have ever played on a phone the animations art style gameplay voice acting story and graphics are fantastically well done there are a few minor bugs and you need a fairly high end phone to run it at max settings but those two problems do not harm the game
4,the game is great it has possibly the best graphics i have ever seen in a game on mobile however there are certain issues to improve within my limited time with this game i have experienced that there are bugs in the ui i select an item and the hovering animation is there but it just does not open it is a bug so i think you guys need to improve your touch detection i was quite irritated by it i have not found any faults otherwise yet
4,absolutely fantastic and beautiful game amazing voice acting fun characters with fun and different lands to explore but cannot bring myself to bring it back to five star yet due to the travesty that was the anniversary event they shut us up with a ten pull and a wing glider but it does not solve the underlying issue of them not communicating and ignoring the players i love this game and want to see it succeed still a very fun game though and i would hate to stop playing because of this issue
5,like playing a console game to pc players i mean no offense that is a major compliment for a game on a phone from me i have other games on my phone of course but this is the first time i have encountered a game that i can play when i am not at home without a switch or laptop just a phone and still get that feeling of a full game experience the animation styles voices story cut scenes fighting style abilities amount of characters unlocking new characters exploring shows the work
5,i can say playing this game was a bit of a slow start but once progress farther into the story you can do so much more i started playing this around sevenpm by the time i notice the time it was am in the morning my only concern is the button layout is a bit too close together i find myself clicking the jump button more often then the attack button when i am in battle that is why i giving a star for controls if i was able to change the layout then it would have gotten a five star instead
4,the game looks gorgeous and there is so much to do it really gives a feeling of a full world to explore as playing on a phone the controls are to be acquainted with the moving stick might get you turning around instead of having clear movement but i guess that can be learned better with more playing i will review this later on as still am on the way to understand the game better
4,i love it one of the best open world games for mobile one problem the audio glitches on android are really bad music is fine most of the time but the tiniest bit of lag which is impossible to avoid on samsung makes the audio cut and come back every second also videos straight up just dont work they will freeze as the messed up audio continues if youre lucky itll unfreeze very later on in the video for a few seconds really ruins the experience sometimes
4,almost everything about this game is great the way the world is open yet it is pretty clear where you need to go to progress the cute character designs plus really pretty graphics only issue is the cutscenes are all janky in some way whether it be freezing on one frame static y audio or both it is really just not pleasant and it sucks because the story is interesting
5,so i am just going to say it this is probably the best open world rpg i have ever played on a phone the moment i realized it might be is when i started playing and saw there was no stupid auto button for combat and questing i am immediately out when i see that option there are a few things that could be improved like the controls can be a little frustrating at times especially the right thumb controls and the world could use more random enemy npcs other then that it is a must play
5,everything is so great about this game the music the scenery the graphics everythings just great it is just that the artifacts drop rate and the random substats upgrade are so annoying it literally take you months to get and build a good one and the resin system is so restrictive with the new bosses it would be much better to have more resins
5,i would say this is the best open world game i have ever played everything is on point the graphics look exactly like the trailers the voice overs for the characters and my favorite feature is that it saves your progress cross platform i switched to my pc and it went back to where i left off it does take a while to download which is understandable because of the graphics the world and individual items but other than that this is my favorite game ever please please please try this out
4,the game works well and the graphics are great however there seem to be glitches in the cut scenes where the screen freezes from time to time and there is no way to customize the on screen controls i have been playing for days and iaps dont seem to be mandatory i have already unlocked of the additional characters without spending a cent
4,i love the graphic designs and the story it takes a while to finish a simple quest yet very entertaining i also like the characters they are so unique the only problem i am having is the camera sensitivity especially with the aiming part it is kinda hard to move the camera in mobile i do not know if it also happens in other devices but hopefully they add a little bit more of that setting overall amazing
5,one of the best games i have ever played such attention to detail from the voiceovers to the storyline and the little mini quests spread throughout the map every characters is fascinating to work with and while i have a long way to go in getting hang of all the elemental details and characters switches in battle i am looking forward to figuring it all out what a calming well constructed game so glad i downloaded it
4,it is been a lot of fun and the microtransactions do not feel aggregious or necessary to play the only issue i have run into is the slowing during cutscenes i have not been able to watch a single cutscenes without the video lagging for ages the audio stays if still sputtering a bit but the video is completely stopped most of the time i am also playing on a new pixel five so it is not a hardware issue other than that i have been having a lot of fun
5,it is great i get lost in the battles and exploring new places on the map almost like playing on a pc good job aside from the massive download and space it took up on my phone it is playability and fun adventures make up for it the only issue i had so far was my phone warming up to fix the issue i just lowered the refresh rate it was set too high over clocking my phones prosessors since then i have had no issues great game worth it thanks for your time sincerely me
2,the combat is fast and fluid and handles multiple enemies better than the witcher or dark souls your character simply attacks the nearest enemy and you are free to move around the battlefield the graphics are gorgeous there is freedom of exploration and so many things to find there are many little puzzles and challenges dotted around this game is a masterpiece and it is free however after a couple weeks there is no more content to explore and only farming remains
5,very good game graphics and art style is fantastic and the game play is smooth and good fun to play the game is full of missions and stuff to do so there is never a point where your lost or not sure how to progress the only point i could recommend for further improvement is the multilayercoop lacks any use at the moment it allows you to explore with each other but i would like to see further expansion on this such as maybe missions together
5,absolutely beautiful game from the beginning this game will show you gorgeous character models environments and you have all the freedom to swim roam and climb as much as your stamina lets you oh the audio it was just beautiful the story as well i wanted to finish prologue first before starting my work but it got me real hooked ah but for some reason cutscenes are very buggy images do not move and transition the audio becomes gritty pretty much the only problem i am having
4,great game beautiful graphics and honestly one of the best soundtracks i have heard in a mobile game there is a few things that annoy me can be very laggy i am on a pixel you cannot exit the app for more than five seconds before it crashes and you have to close and re open it very frustrating especially if you want check a text or a wiki page
5,i absolutely love and adore this game by far my favorite story roleplaying game out there the quests lore plots mysteries grind pulls all of it i am a newer player but i have not been bored yet of this game i do not think i ever will i would say it is biggest issues is lagging and setting it is quality different on its own as well as occasional bugs on my laptop if the frame per secondfps could be a bit quicker that would be great but other than that the game is beautiful will update
5,addictive watch out or this game will take all of your time and maybe some of your money it is a bit difficult to play on mobile much easier on a game console like playstation where there is definition between buttons it also drives me a bit crazy that i have to keep zooming out again and again but the game is well done graphics are great i have not had any problems except that i seem to spend too much time playing it was made in china and they are probably getting data from this game
4,lovely game the story graphics and combat system are all great the only negatives are the gacha system which you can ignore if you focus on the story instead of collecting and upgrading characters and the immense size of the game i might have to uninstall it because it is just too big the crazy thing is that the game is super slow on a computer so that is not an option either i have to turn the graphics all the way down for it to be playable on my phone and it still crashes sometimes
4,absolutely amazing runs great on my phone and the storyline is really engaging however it takes a ridiculous amount of storage so if you dont have storage to spare i would not reccomend if you do however the controls and gameplay mechanics are easy enough to get the hang of and i would highly reccomend playing it i no longer have enough storage left to play it on my phone or laptop but it was great while it lasted
5,great graphics and animations good voice acting awesome waifus and story is decent enough to follow combat is awesome but on mobile it is kinda hard but enjoyable something to fix is like while minimizing you should not be able to disconnect it is annoying when you are looking up a guide or something for a couple minutes or even seconds and you disconnect also being able to adjust your controls would be helpful the configuration now is okay but editing them would be nice
5,its an amazing game the graphics are so adorable the game play is good and the story is even better i realized that if you go into the other areas there are not any voice acting and it is not as fun maybe if yall fixed those parts maybe put in some more chapters to the stories some voice acting make the map larger or put in another element the character can learn i feel like that would make the game so interesting amazing game keep up the good work
5,this is what i have been looking for in a mobile arpg experience for so long i am at adventurer level seven and so far have not run into any auto play nonsense and each quest in the first levels seems to grant a new character the gacha is there but pretty unnecessary in the early game as far as i can tell all of the characters are well thought out and the story is captivating animations and art are amazing and fluid and the voice acting is top notch especially for a free game i love it
5,this game is spectacular i cannot believe that i am playing a game of this level on my phone it is more like a console game seriously you have to try it the open world format is wonderful the english voice acting is great and the animated cut scenes blend seamlessly into gameplay just be sure you have good wifi or an amazing high speed data plan the only thing missing is gamepad support there is an option to submit feedback in game if we all suggest it they might add gamepad support
4,it is a lovely game the graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is amazing the character design is gorgeous and the story line is fun to follow i have only been playing for a day but i am already having so much fun the only thing stopping me from rating this five stars is that sometimes during the longer cut scenes lag out the audio will glitch or a combination of both i would have to close out the app and restart it restarting the cut scene besides that it is a wonderful game ten over ten
5,it takes a lot of time to load at first for me it took an hour but after that the next time it loads it is fast the graphics are everything the characters are voiced and you can tell that the people put effort into making this it is just a little glitchy when you have to fight stormterror as all i could see was just rays of colours and tip to the beginners do not just close the app there will be an option to exit click that or else your data will not be saved but overall it is a nice game
5,let me just start by saying i cannot believe that this is a mobile game the graphics are unbelievable the open world system is incredible the quests characters animations and everything about it is amazing it is very fun grinding for wishes trying to get a new character it gives the game at least one thing to do and to strive for constant updates and bug fixes and limited time events make it that much better if you are going to play do it go genshin impact please give me a five star star star star star
5,beautiful game honestly i am not one to play rpgs at all really and this game is just a joy to play the only real issue i have is that cutscenes lag and freeze a lot like i have to close out the game frequently and reload everything to get it to work ninefive of the time other than that even though i barely just started the game mechanics are easy to understand and figure out and the camera is only slightly wonky but overall pretty dang good only thing that needs a fix is cutscenes
4,genshin impact is extremely addicting and entertaining and there is always something for you to do or a new quest to receive however sometimes the game becomes extremely laggy and it is frustrating to be honest though that is really my only concern a wonderful game with lots of wonderful storyboards it does become pay to win near the end though which is annoying but for the most part you can get big starting from nothing recommended for those who enjoy games such as toram online and botw
5,the game is pretty good on top of that they have high quality it is sometimes annoying while hunting or talking with the charters the voice gets fussy and glitchy so does the screen i do not quite understand the settings i hope you make the tutorial a bit easier to understand without these problems the game is amazing i recommend it if you like these kind of games have a great day
5,love this game it reminds me so much of final fantasy game in game play but the best part is that you can be different characters and not just stuck with the main also it seems to have no end to events and game quest although the camera could use a little more work when fighting enemies but otherwise i like the overall control and game play story is also not hard to follow
5,i absolutely love this game it is the best experience you can get for mobile when it comes to open world games it controls nice and the ui is done amazingly though i do tend to have an issue with accidentally pressing and holding the attack button when trying to move the camera but it does not ruin the experience the only feature i would recommend adding is offline play as that would make the game more accessible to people though that is my opinion
5,i love this game it has beautiful graphics characters and animals maybe the sounds that the characters make are a bit perverted but it is bearable i also like that we get free stuff on start maybe the daily tasks are starting to get a bit boring and monotonous but for primo i will do anything cut scenes are really great all the effects that are there are refined animation deserves a nobel
4,whoa it is a great game once you manage to download nearly six gb of it but after that it is an engrossing story with great graphics and nice quests the music is calming would really appreciate if the game takes you know uses more data i have a high speed connection but still the game shows my bandwidth as too slow while other apps load without a pause i do not know how it is how it works but yeah it is a con
4,good game graphics are well done with only a few wall issues for the most part the camera is responsive and in auto mode it usually stays well focused sometimes when in a small space the camera zooms in so far that you cannot see what you are doing the enemies and power scaling are fairly balanced mage and sword combat is smooth archers are a bit clumbsy overall still a good game that could use a few tweaks to be great
4,i like this game so much i really do it is quite entertaining and all and it is got me hooked the problems that i got however are the loading times when you boot up the game are quite long i suppose that is to be expected but the one thing that bugs me the most is that some cut scenes will not show out like the starting cut scene or the cut scene where you fly to shoot the stormterror please fix this
5,love this game the story is great the side missions entertaining they have been very receptive about feedback oh and the graphics are top notch love the colors and crisp quality my only issue is the controls in some scenarios like in between rocks or next to a wall characters get stuck or focus on the wrong way and i end up wasting a skill
5,the game is really beautiful and fun and i find it as the best free and beautiful multiplatform game but my only problem is the constant crashes and fps spikes i understand that the game is huge because of the big world and graphics but as a mobile player it is hard to play when i constantly crash but overall the game is perfect keep up the good work
4,great game love the visuals and story the game itself is the work of a mastermind i have only one issue the server connectivity network speeds are slow even with strong connectivity in my area i also had issues with the story it hangs up the frame freezes while narrating the story i hope you get rid of this error in future updates please help me if possible i found the missions really interesting the story is very endearing i hope a liter version is provided in the future
3,great game but i do not like how there is so much going on there are several missions several characters several character missions way too many spots on the map which is good if you like sandbox games and it takes up way too much storage do not get me wrong it is super fun it is exactly breath of the wild but i do not know if i want to play genshin impact anymore because every time i think of it i feel overwhelmed be prepared for a long cutscene at the beginning requires internet
3,the game it self is great and the gameplay is not bad at all the game can run to some devices that has at least four gb of ram but there are some issues when i always start running the game like stops constantly and automatically exits which is a big problem for some players that enjoys playing the game i hope the game will soon be updated and optimized for low end phones and devices so that more players can play and enjoy the game
2,finally playing on playstation the game needs contrast on a phone it is a little easier to see stuff than on playstation but only because you are physically closer to the screen the colors all sadly blend together so it is quite hard to tell whats what but it looks super nice just hard to see details so far great game just needs some color adjustment update the storyline does not make any sense
4,it takes a super long time to load i hope they make the software easier to process on some devices because it takes so long to load and it runs very slow on a decent computer other than that the game is amazing its easy to pick up its worldbuilding is phenominal you fall in love with the characters and it is free it doesnt free a ton of space tho lmao
5,i do not know if this is a bug but me and my friend started to play the opening cinematics had ingame audio once the game started when i was roaming around my friend and i noticed the ingame audio was gone after the cinematics i hope this can be fixed right away update fixed it so far i am loving the story even subquests it is really a change of phase i feel immersed into the story and land of genshin impact more power to the developers
3,this is a very good game i just have two problems it keeps freezing my phone after ten minutes of gameplay and it is really annoying having to boot it back up after five minutes and the second problem it takes up so much space i constantly have to delete apps to make space for a new update and it never gets any better otherwise i love it but at least make it a bit easier to get new characters i hope you can fix these problems a very excited yet disappointed fan
4,it is really a nice game to play i would give it five stars but crashes and bugs happen from time to time everything else is fine it happened during the start of the game the screen freezes the part when there was a dragon it bugged you cannot see properly and every intro crashes or freezes the screen the audio becomes very choppy the only that was working well was the subtitles so i hope you can fix this
5,highly anticipated game that is finally arrived i beta tested the playstation version and was sold immediately playing the mobile version for the st time it is definitely designed well for touch screen phones graphically great sounds and voices are on point and gameplay is fluid responsive only issue so far is the freezing especially during cinematics it is not game breaking but it needs more optimizing for smart phones st day release so issues will arise once that is fixed it will be perfect
5,fantastic if your device can run it then go for it great story fantastic visuals wonderful characters it is a great time my only gripe is that i wish they rerun past events be prepared for it to use a bunch of storage and drain your battery i personally use it as a quasi backup for the playstation five version play that first so you can save your progress elsewhere
4,just perfect great story simple controls awesome graphics and gaming in general with a cool new open world co op multiplayer rpg d anime style kind of concept i just need a more powerfull device to get back to playing it it is just impossible for me to ever get tired playing it but still just like any other game this one provides some advantage for those willing to pay for special items basically those generic in game purchases wich are a bummer but anyway
4,it is an amazing game both lore and gameplay wise the action and combat in this game are really good although in mobile the graphics are a bit hard to control aiming and shooting are really difficult and sometimes even simple things like activating a wind glider becomes a bit difficult although if you are going for the story you should download this game if you want a smoother experience i would recommend a computer for better gameplay
4,the game overall is really good great updates and events a beautiful and huge map to explore and it is not even complete yet not to talk about the lore which is awesome despite the fact that the company sometimes makes bad mistakes the late game experience being a bit boring and limited and the prices for in game purchases not being too good for some regions brazil as an example it is an awesome game and it is worth trying
3,this is so slow xd changing characters is slow running is slow the glide takes you straight down instead of letting you fly i love the art the effects and things to do but mannn it is so slow there is so much space to drive around but no vehicles i love that i can skip but i live the fast life is there a character that is built for speed i cannot wait to explore more and see what else there is tho
5,this is a really good app and they fix your problems no matter what but i do have a problem that needs fixing i have been sending reports about the problem the problem is that it crashes paimon says dont go there or we will explore that area latter and there is glitching sounds and after that happening for a good few seconds it makes a bell sound and it acts up so much and it has been going on for months i sent at least or four reports please fix this in the future at least thank you
5,the game is fantastically rich in detail and i have yet to get sick of climbing up everything and jumping off to glide long distances the only problem so far is that the archery controls are really awkward to use outside of puzzles at least on mobile platforms hitting anything is maddening if you need to move aim charge the attack and then hit a rapidly moving target
5,an entertaining game with outstanding graphics and voice actors i love it it runs perfectly fine on mobile as mine meets or even goes over the requirements needed to run the game smoothly people complaining about how slow it is might be because their ram does not meet the requirement just a little problem with the storage space it takes but it is understandable if i want good graphics
4,the only thing i find unpleasant abou this game is how much it takes up storage plus the constant updates wich makes it difficult to adjust other then that great game great graphics great gameplay and easy to understand well not at the start but once you learn the basics your fine there is a chance i will delete the game for a while but i can see myself going back to it
4,this game took mobile gaming in to the next level i really love the graphics but a few cons from my personal experience my network is pretty good but i am getting red ping sometimes the fps drops and gets a bit laggy regarding the controls if it was possible to adjust the placement of keys it would hav been nice i kind of needed active co op missions dungeons world boss etc i do not know if it is waiting ahead cuz im writing this after two days of game play
4,i have not played the game for too long but im having a problem with the audio it is fuzzy and choppy kinda like if you plugged in speakers or headphones halfway i do not have have audio problems with any other apps or games im not sure if it is something on my end or the game itself other than that the graphics look great and the game runs smoothly
3,this game is absolutely amazing incredible graphics an amazing storyline and interesting characters however my phone can no longer hold the game the amount of storage this takes is ridiculous and i am going to have to uninstall because i would like to have other apps on my phone if you really enjoy genshin impact it is ultimately better to play on a different device it runs very smoothly and storage is not a problem when i play on pc
3,please add the ability to change the game settings from the login screen it is very difficult to switch from pc with high graphics settings to mobile which requires lower graphics settings the game locks up too much on mobile before i can get to the menus in game to change it or add the ability to set the graphics settings for mobile and pc separately other than this great game
2,the gameplay is great controls need to be reworked implementing a idle and a combat interface would be a good idea stealth kills are a good idea too and a crouch button and as well as an evasion button it is a good idea to implement options to change the interface to personal liking because whenever i turn my camera i am able to accidentally press and hold the attack button another thing is the camera just moving by itself when in combat i get headaches just from the weird angles it has
4,a very nice game really love the design gameplay story and many more i hope that you guys can continue doing the good work personally the issue i found about the game is storage took about four of my phones storage other issue is the combat camera settings very hard to control because sometimes while in combat the camera glitched through walls or floor so its hard to fight sometimes overall quite enjoy the game
3,i really had fun playing this game despite having a freezing cutscenes the issue is that stormterror and signoriai forget the name have texture glitches please i beg you please fix it it is so hard to fight the bosses alone and the texture glitches makes it almost impossible i hope you will consider this issue most of us are experiencing it so i hope you will fix it im really looking forward to it thank you for creating this game
4,dynamic gameplay awesome graphics and complex lore content comes out at a comfortable pace great variety of limited time events so there is a bit of everything for everybody main issue is the lack of receptivity on part of the game towards player feedback people have been complaining about resin asking for buffs to characters that have fallen off etc but changes not forthcoming i will keep playing but will not recommend cannot say it will be worth for sure many games out there to choose
4,i absolutely love this game my mind revolves around it four seven i was overjoyed to find this on my chromebook but i did have some issues the whole log in process was extremely slow and when i did get in the animation quality was quite poor i even tried to adjust it also after ish days i had trouble getting into the game like the screen is just black and if i click close it turns white and i have to go to the top right corner to exit again ah also the sound sometimes just lags
5,i love the style and atmosphere of this game in many ways it reminds me of breath of the wild one of my faves however some aspects are improved like the cooking and the fact that once you collect a certain weapon it will not break the one thing i am most impressed with is how much they reward you for exploration i tend to just hunt for teleport wards and so along the way i find lots of camps and treasure i really recommend this game but just beware you need a device that can manage data
3,the game we all wanted genshin impact you need to play this game as it is a open world exploration fights characters etc the characters look so cool and their voices are awesome the only improvement is about the battles and also sometimes when i open it it takes me to a black screen and closes the game and i am not able to play for so long time until if fixes please fix this glitch
4,amazing game amazing storyline i really like how you added other characters that we can play with during he story and elements we can choose from the only reason i give it a four star is the pc problem the amount of times i had to get out of the game and open it again so it could continue to download is way to much it sometimes even crashed and i would not continue
4,this game is phenomenal and i dont want to put it down it is a bit of a battery drain but for the amount of game that your phone is rendering put the charger on and go at it the graphics are wonderful the music is amazing the ai is challenging but not unbeatable especially at lower levels the characters are super balanced and the damage is weight y my only complaints with the game are that it needs bluetooth controller specifically playstation controller and to increase the exp dropped
4,it is amazing i love the game the graphics and controls are very nice yet after a while maybe a month and a half or so i have ran into an issue as i play on my phone i can only play for around five minutes or so maybe even less and it starts to lag and stutter the ping suddenly skyrocketing and stuff like that i tested my phone out with other games similar and they ran perfectly fine besides that it is still a good game would recommend
5,not enough words to express how amazing this game is to me giant open world with tons to explor lots of different characters to mix and match on your team the graphics are amazing the scenery is so beautiful the music is just as gorgeous and there is so much lore the combat is smooth and strategic letting you switch your characters around in the middle of a fight to create combos using their elemental skills also you can cross play this game with friends or solo everything
1,the game is great really fun controls are great really fun story and conversations could improve a bit do not get me wrong they are not bad but could improve the only problem i have and i believe it is a problem worth of star review is that you cannot take your save from one server to another i moved to a different country and now the game has become unplayable i do not really care about lag the problem is i keep getting disconnected it is incredibly annoying plz solve this
5,knowing that its released the gameplay is amazing nice graphics easy controls open world etc the only downfalls that i have encountered playing is the cutscenes it freezes up the other is phone overheating when it heats up you lose progress but other than those the game is amazing great to play keep up the work d
3,the game is really nice but there are some aspects that i do not like first of all although there is only game and applications on my phone it freezes excessively when opening wish and six levels to play with friends it is ridiculous to be i get a lot of muscle while walking or something please fix them i call it freezing i cannot walk etc other than that the characters are great but even though i have few characters no characters appear i think i will increase my chances
3,the gameplay story graphics soundtrack and animations are all absolutely amazing the open world is perfect and the quests are engaging the characters are all unique and well created voiced only reason for stars is the game makes my phone hot enough to fry an egg and it drains my battery faster than it can charge if i play while plugged in severely limiting my play time some optimization improvements and it would certainly be deserving of five stars
4,the game was exceptional with a beautiful open world and lots to do my personal favourite is using my glider the quests are very satisfying the cooking system is a bit too oversimplified i would say i kind of wished they would let us choose what element we want though at the getgo our character chooses anemo at least mine did controls are smooth story is a bit generic but not cliché the battle system is exciting and fun and the whole thing feels breath of the wild definitely worth it
5,this game has a lot of basic stuff that works the same as breath of the wild cooking gliding climbing etc but it makes it unique the storyline is engaging and i actually care about it which i cannot say about most other freeplays the art is amazing especially for its open world and sometimes i find myself running around aimlessly because i wanna see whats on top of a cliff and if there is a treasure chest there the only issue is that some of the lines do not match what the voice actor says
4,did not think a mobile game could be that good that said there are a few annoying things that i wanna point out first there is no way to set waypoints to locations unless its an objective or mission second when setting a waypoint through map to a place that isnt an actual mission like ley lines it does not show the way there it just highlights it on the minimap if those features get added this is definitely a five star game even if not its still a really fantastic experience for mobile
4,four stars cause it has lot of bugs and glitches and some commissions slow down the game i hope they fix that the most annoying is that u have wait and stand for a few seconds everytime u need to pick up something moreover the graphics are great one more thing the checking for updates things forever soemtimes and the game will not start until i restart the game so please fix that too thanks for reading and giving ur time for user reviews
5,my only complaint is that every cut scene the game cannot keep up with itself the audio and video de sync the video stops all together and then the audio crackles exiting the app and re entering it helps briefly other than that the game itself is truely one of it is kind superb graphics easy to learn controls open world adventure amazing quests and side quests it has a story that is honestly a blast to follow i would give this a nine per ten if the cut scenes werent so bad it would one hundred percent ten over ten
4,this game is adventurous fun exciting and eventful you can defeat bosses meet new companions and buddies and explore forests mountains lakes and much more although on mobile if you have not enough space and delete games you really like and end up still having not enough space its frustrating and annoying please make the game smaller or just lower the detail so it doesnt take up that much storage space
5,so far i have been loving it it is better than botw ff and tes blades i am very impressed with how much they were able to cram into the game weapons magic dialogue cutscenes excellent physics and optional chores like cooking smithing and hunting it is all come together as though this is our first look at what a handheld console experience will look like on android and it is far better than i expected there is inventory map quests exploring fast travel puzzles and arcade style combat
5,it is relatively new so i allowed for some grievances my rating is based strictly on my enjoyment of gameplay characters power system and story however the game still has a few bugs to iron out you may not experience any difficulty on a flagship samsung or iphone ect but just keep in mind it requires good phone specs for the best experience and to minimize the chance of bugs or crashes also i am surprised to see it is not pay to win can progress for free but you will want to buy stuff
4,game runs pretty smoothly sometimes better than my pc but i have got a few issues cannot listen to music apps in the background because this app closes em it is pretty annoying after you switch apps for a second it takes you back to login loading screen sometimes it crashes for no reason saying game not responding four resin replenishes so slowly h it should be six at least but even though it is pretty good graphics story characters locations game mechanics are epic
3,it is a great game really fun even without paying for wishes only two complaints it can seriously be a grind when trying to get the right components to level up your characters but it is purposely designed that way the game is not compatible with game controllers so you have to use the touch screen system do not understand why the company does not like android phones
4,at first i have never played a game like this but man it gave a good first impression and i love playing it right now the ability to choose how the game looks through the graphics customizer is a very good touch great gameplay a little descriptive on how things work but you start to understand quickly and simplify it in your own way only problem is that sometimes the cutscenes freeze and the audio kinda splices itself and i cant make out what it says like a cd skipping great game guys
5,cannot play well with low to mid end devices it freezes during cutscenes and the game has graphic bugs like their faces disappear or the skins bitmaps extend to the entire screen where you can see nothing although i love the game and would like to see it grow i am giving it a five star review but in exchange would you add optimal settings for weaker phones pretty please
4,the interface feels more natural to navigate on mobile than pc but the combat controls are lacking additionally there does not seem to be an option for gamepad controls on mobile despite the pc client supporting them otherwise the game runs fluidly on a relatively high end device with plenty of content and relatively impressive graphics
4,the combat is so easy to learn and is super fun to mess around with the graphics are honesty breathtaking my phone is filled with screetshots from this game the storyline is somewhat less impressive depending on the region it can go to fantastic to downright bad another low point is the small amount of currency available to free to play for a billion dollar game the amount of free stuff they give out is appalling overall it is a very good game though i would not recommend it to friends
4,definitely a great game that is made great strides compared to the first time i installed it it is still very laggy especially as the game includes more but it is improved it is not very free to play friendly though for the amount of characters coming out the spacing of events and primos possible make it very difficult to achieve getting characters i experienced this in a major way as a beginner because of the large gap in what i wanted versus what was possible
4,i wish there was a system where you can pet the dogs cats but other than that the games pretty fun i have experienced multiple bugs where when you teleport to a way point it glitches you through the map and you die instantly from the fall damage and then when you try to teleport somewhere else you fall through the map and die again also the last couple times i did the use ten wishes at once thing it bugged out took my wishes crashed and did not give me anything bummer
5,this game contains a really cool open world that you can explore which lots of neat little extras to go along with it you can glide cook forge weapons and more as for the battle system it is real time and element based paired with an experienced based leveling system and various characters you can choose to use in battle the world also holds culture and lore that you can explore and there is many hidden secrets waiting to be found
5,i have had a really good experience playing the game and have been trying to hold in my excitement since the beginning of the year the gameplay is really smooth and i enjoy using the unique movesets on each character i also love gacha as well as open world games so putting together was a great idea gacha is optional one problem is that every time i leave the app and come back it says reconnecting but i can understand why and it does not take that long so it is not too much of a problem
4,the game is absolutely gorgeous to look at and the voice over and music feels really polished as well however from my initial impression i think i can suggest some improvments the charecter movement in the open feels somewhat slow an increase in the base movement speed would be nice or an artifact that increases the movement speed is also welcomed archer class needs an auto aim lock feature an option to force sixtyfps would also be nice four control reposition option would be great
4,overall concept of this game is very simple and complex at the same time graphics are stunning so many things to explore through adventure boss fights are extremely difficult still i think developers can create little bit of balance in hero characters it will be extremely hard for anyone to defeat world level bosses without at least one five star character i am facing same difficulty as i do not have one yet
3,the game is really fun very entertaining but i have some concerns i do not know if it is just me but when i first downloaded the game the quality was perfection but now it is very blurry and blunt and the sound crashes a lot which makes me suddenly get out of the game and the storage is a huge problem after the seven update my phone just couldnt take it so i had to uninstall but it does run very nicely on my pc or ipad without any problems
2,it is slow no matter how many storage you have or how good you wifi is dont get me wrong it is a very good game but it keeps crashing and the environment models looses texture half the time and i am not sure if it is just me but the last time it crashed my whole tablet kept turning on and off and i had to power it off then try to make it work thankfully it is alright now
3,game starts as rather fun but the longer you play the more design and gameplay flaws you encounter overall experience can be summarized as following pros fun to explore world with various puzzles decent story regular various events note due to the big differences in event gameplay mechanics some may be to your liking and some may not but considering overall variety it will still be a positive thing four smooth combat albeit lacking some necessary ui elements cons daily routine becomes too repetitive and boring after finishing world exploration character progression is horrible with excessive rng elements where it should not be in the first place looking at you artifact domains developers feedback is lacking and issues that have been bothering players since day are still unaddressed conclusion overall it may be ok to try this game for a bit just do not expect much in the long term
5,progressive game play wonderful visuals loads of stuff to do and easy to follow instructions have yet to try team play only two things i do not like there is no way to get reverse vertical camera control on android as far as i know and i really dislike when you reach the edge of the area you are currently allowed to explore and you are just propelled back rather than a more natural barrier like a too high cliff for your current stamina level overall a great game i like
5,amazing game cannot believe it is a mobile game and free to play the storyline and side quest stories are all really interesting the characters are fun and all have very purposeful skills the design and music is lovely and adds a lot to the experience overall just a wonderful game that i have gotten addicted to really quickly a little repetitive when you have to farm for items but that does not detract much at all from the experience
5,literally im so addicted this game is amazing it is so smooth the graphics are amazing and the characters are all so well designed the story is immersive and the characters you meet along the way make the journey all the better i would like a feature where you could change your traveler but the game is doing just fine without it there is always so much fun events and the gacha system is so much better than other games i one hundred recommend it
5,this game is amazing the graphics the story the characters everything i cannot stop playing it however i think some features can be added to better the experience i suggest you include a trading system between players another thing i heard from a friend is that the enemies levels be averaged with the partys rather than adventure rank finally another thing to include is a chat log in case if the player misses any important dialogue
4,september twenty eight twenty twenty right now i am playing on a samsung galaxy s ten set on high performance to make sure i can play this game although since yesterday things were going well without issue but as of now i am struck in the first town because of the cutscene lagging and freezing along with audio turning to static and pops and the worse part of this is when i think that cutscene is over it loops back and replays it over again update september twenty twenty nine twenty twenty it seems to be working now after un and re installing it
5,you can tell a lot of love and money went into the game the graphics are gorgeous and there are surprisingly deep storylines even in the side characters if you have seen a trailer then go ahead and expect that level of detail in the actual game aim controls can be a little tricky on mobile and sometimes sound quality might dip a bit during action sequences i am using a galaxy s ten but otherwise good gameplay highly recommend
4,the anniversary rewards are lackluster and the performance on the phone is harsh and heats up the device too fast that being said the game while being played on a device that can handle it is fantastic the characters are charismatic and easily loveable the progression of both story and difficulty is well balanced and there is always something to do even in end game i highly recommend this to someone who enjoys open world rpgs with the occasional multiplayer beautiful game overall
3,it is a big game takes up a lot of room on the device one i got into the game i could see why it is truly an immersive world you can explore all of it i enjoyed the stories and graphics the dungeons seem shallow they are over very quickly like most mobile games i would continue playing but it stopped working the loading screen with the seven symbols used as a progress bar always freezes there i tried the repair feature it says all files are fine due to size i do not want redownload
5,this game is incredibly beautiful the animations are seamless and the music is immersive there are no ads and they do not push for you to pay for anything it is a truly wonderful experience playing this game the only thing i would change is making a way for players to use a bluetooth controller as the touch controls are a little difficult sometimes during intense battles
5,i do not play this game on mobile since it is so heavy on my device and often causes it to overheat however i am an avid pc player of genshin impact and this game has got to be one of my absolute favorites the characters are almost all enticing the stories are fantastic and the designs even more so there are small things that need to be fixed like the resin system or the artifact hunting but honestly those are small things i highly recommend this game
4,the main story is maintained and our objectives are clear choices are here and sometimes matter and sometimes do not the graphics are good and enjoyable the designs of the characters are well made and easy to remember the map is pretty big for an open world mobile game maybe a few things to work on for the devs add more quests and more mobs for us to have more divertissement and things to discover
5,first immersive rpg that i have ever played on my phone the game mechanics are well designed the graphic is stunning traveling feels smooth it reminds me of kingdoms of amalur however this type of free form traveling can sometime be a bit frustrating on a mobile ui due to it being hard to control your character to move around overall amazing game especially one that is multi platform with mobile included
4,i am playing on my pixel and it runs smoothly and beautifully the game is very bright and colourful refreshing and it looks like a really well done game my issues are the controlling can be utterly annoying sometimes and the sound after a few minutes the sound goes all glitchy and horrible i wanted this game on the switch what a massive let down when there is not even news of when it will come out so i can fully enjoy this game on a portable console where you can control things properly
4,the game is exceptional it is like being in a console world using my phone although it does feel like having a console in my phone coz ot cannot keep up with the graphics i do wish there were some way they could loosen up the background or some way to loosen the graphics so that my gb ram phone can handle it but it truly is an exceptional game i love the fact that i do not see other players too xd makes it feel more personal
4,it is fun and beautiful the fact that it is free is insane however some of the tasks i wish had more direction like a help section for tasks or a hint since some tasks were way easier than how long it took to complete also i wish the tutorial was available at all times sometimes i have not been online in some time so i forget some key info that would help other than this it is absolutely a five
3,the game is really good but please make it a mobile friendly game we know that this was originally a pc game but the mobile app heats up the phone when playing the graphics is good but with so much happening during challenges tasks and fights the game frames eventually lag even if it was already put on a lowest graphic settings one of the reasons why u have to restart the app another thing during the story telling part the screen sometimes froze hope you can acknowledge this thanks
3,great game over all with an engaging storyline and cool characters even if you do not purchase premium items and units the game is not unplayable yet i am not too far in and that could change however from a technical standpoint i have been having trouble running the app since the latest update at first it was just some stuttering frames at times but now just going into a menu is enough to crash the app entirely it was running fine a week ago but not anymore
3,its a fantastic game very good on battles and story but it is lacking alot of things for starters there are cut scenes that need to be fixed in terms of when characters come into play second the graphics are quite splotchy and does not look as nice when you get close it may also help to make it better for far less optimized devices edited
4,this game is great the graphic is very well made the plot is not bad either and i really like the power system in this game is quite unique and interesting the control is smooth and all the characters is so beautiful especially lisa 😏 however the game always crash after playing for or hours i do not really mind it cause i just took a short break when ever it crash but there might be a player that will find it really annoying and frustrating so try to fix that overall i give it four star
3,the game is fun and all the plot is really good but overtime the app crashing is becoming over bearing ever since i downloaded this the app keeps crashing and sometimes i have to repeat my quest because of it and when kaeya freezes the water i cannot seem to see the ice bridge which makes it very difficult for me to walk on water i also cannot see the damages my characters does how would i know my progress if i do not see it maybe when this is fixed i will give it a full five star
5,love the design and ui awesome char design and world building a few tiny cons the archer controls are not that good there is no sneaking aiming lacks accuracy as well as movements on narrow surfaces like a fallen trunk dialogues have choices but so far most have the same result its a heavy install just the update took eight gb but all in all i love it
4,it is a great mmorpg game different from others with awesome graphics and i really like is that the game is cross platform which is convenient concept is impressive but i have been playing it since they start and i stopped playing after an year or so and downloaded it back again game has gotten a lot advanced than it was before and it is really difficult to get of the top of things back again they need to give a head start to the players who join back after a long time
4,this is a great game and i think its even better as a mobile game as compared to a console game because the menu navigation is much faster and easier when you can touch the screen i do however wish there was an option to use a controller because the game runs hot and i dont want to touch the screen the whole time just when doing menu stuff like inventory and cooking and stuff
5,probably the best game i have ever played amazing character design and story great graphics and very fun gameplay great for streaming calming down or just a rainy night you can play it with friends too people will put bad reviews and say it is not good or that it is too time consuming but really it is outstanding if you are always busy just do the quests in small parts however i do recommend getting it on a computer rather than a mobile device it sometimes lags and if harder to play on
4,good game but the version ruined the gameplay for me unlike in the previous version where it was still running smoothly i cannot even play it decently the screen keeps freezing up it is like watching a powerpoint presentation please fix edit the game is running better now but there is no option to update it to v as of writing
4,this game is absolutely one of the best games i have ever played on my phone the open word is amazing the character design and graphics are amazing it gets me hooked into it for hours on end the only two problems that i am experiencing so far is with the game mechanics is that it starts glitching out sometimes it usally happens when a couple of enemies are running or attacking me along with that another one is sometimes the game freezes for a second to two when i am in the middle of combat
4,i honestly love the game so much and its the first time i have ever spent this much time and effort on a single game everything from character design to backstory visuals to music and even gameplay and story plot are amazing it is just the rewards the game gives do not really feel worth the effort put in for example high ar level up rewards and the anniversary rewards as well still the game is super fun and ten over ten would recommend anyone to play it
3,beautiful game beautiful music i would not recommend if you are not prepared to grind do not expect to get characters unless you grind and save for at least full updates or spend money artifact system desperately needs to change many characters are in need of reworks and or buffs i am hoping they will eventually do something about this but i doubt it will change after a certain level playing often feels like a chore and can lose almost all enjoyability
5,game is gorgeous character designs are really nice and even though i have only played for like an hour i am pretty hooked although i really wish the joystick could be switched to floating i always miss it and end up spinning around trying to get oriented lol edit there is some sort of sound issue inside the cathedral the sound went crazy and was all broken and distorted
2,the game is good and it has potential to be great but after nearly years of playing it next to nothing has been changed still got the same old boring routine if you do not count the artifact farming and dailies there is no endgame besides abyss events are always temporary never permanent with which i do not have a problem with but some of these events for example the hide and seek one could make a great permanent feature in the game edit i wanna say more but there is not enough space left
3,the game has amazing graphics and give acting to boot but the amount of glitches that i experienced was unbelievable it could be my wifi but the entire time the game just glitches out the faces away surrounding keep disappearing and you cannot really see anything but glowing neon grass on the floor i will not say it has to others who like the game but personally it was something i couldnt okay even if i wanted to i look forward to the upcoming updates
3,i have been playing for almost a year now one year next week i think and i love the game i have been able to bond with people from my new school because of it gameplay story and characters are so amazing although this only gets and it is bc ever since january my game has been crashing alot i cannot go ten minutes without it crashing this has happened before when i first started but after a month or two it want away but it all of a sudden came back
4,great game the only reason i gave it a four and not a five is the control mechanism for mobile there have been quite a few times when i would try to move the camera around and i would either accidentally jump or attack if you could make the ui maybe half an inch small that would be perfect other than that the character design the storyline and the visuals of the game are amazing for just a mobile game great job cognosphere pte llc love the game
5,really takes inspiration from the legend of zelda breath of the wild and pulls off the concept well with functionality and style i love how open and unrestricted you are for exploration i think it was a good choice to not have an auto move button as the charm of the game was really the exploration and combat i am currently at rank ten and i do not know if we will unlock more but it would be great if we could have more options to bookmark certain areas i e dungeon challenges d
5,here is the thing i absolutely love this game the characters are super loveable the gameplay is fun ninefive of the time graphics are phenomenal but this is only on pc maybe console i have not played it on console yet if you try to play this on your phone or tablet you will be disappointed the controls are confusing it is constantly lagging graphics become very slow and pixelated so if you are planning on playing on pc or console go for it it is super enjoyable otherwise do not bother
4,the gameplay and graphics are extremely excellent compared to other free d games depending on your device of course the design of the newest characters are extraordinary and the cinematics are just mind blowing however this game lacks of creativity if we are talking about the events and the rewards we get are as disappointing but whats fun about this game is not the events but playing with your favorite characters and making them stronger exploring the world and finishing the quests
4,this game is absolutely stunning and the designers have really outdone themselves characters are engaging and interesting story is intriguing and well thought out graphics are stunning it is a little confusing navigating the game at first because there is not a lot of guidance but that encourages the player to run around and explore so why the four stars the massive amount of space it takes up on my phone almost thirty g is forcing me to uninstall unfortunately gonna see if my laptop can run it
4,it is an amazing game the graphics are on a different level absolutely incredible only thing is it takes up sooo much storage and it is really hard to get your favourite characters without spending hours on quests and farming for chests like the chances of getting a five star is in ninety wishes i have spent the past days trying to save up but i am no where near close though on a more serious note i do hope they come up with a way to keep storage down bc it is used up fifty of mine highly recommend
4,it is an amazing app but it is getting hard to continue to play on mobile it is taking up a bunch of storage infact after two point seven i will have point zero four gb left plus as new characters come out older characters dont have reruns as much ex kazuha and the lag on mobile is frustrating but i do like the idea of an ascension quest it helps me prepare for higher leveled enemies and lets me stay at a world level i am comfortable at the graphics are also absolutely wonderful they are beautiful
5,controls are a bit wonky on mobile i have to reach my left thumb quite a bit to shift to a faster walk i would love a control scheme change option in the setting to place buttons where you are most comfortable or scale things to size also i think sometimes my bluetooth earbuds do something to the game to make the audio a bit staticy but it could just be me amazing graphics and a lovely story give it a try it may be your new favorite adventure game
4,hundreds of hours of cool unique beautiful free gameplay the end game is lackluster when you simply run out of quests with no more reasons to kill monsters and explore if you do not stress about farming good gear or the abyss mode where you need good gear or the best heroes then there is very little to be disappointed about very relaxing game take your time focus on maximizing fun not on maximizing character team power enjoy
5,excellent game i enjoy that it is not one of those on rails rpgs that does all the walking and flight for you it encourages you to explore the world and it is jammed packed full of treasure and mobs but spaced enough to let you enjoy the scenery so far i have not seen anything in it being pay to win which is definitely good fights are challenging and knowing how elements affect other elements makes battles all the more strategic it is also quite beautiful and filled with lots of lore
3,great game so far but lacking in options it needs controller support or at least the ability to adjust the location of the controls on screen i have a nine screen and the controls are set for a six nine screen too close to the center to be comfortable also progress from playstation should be carried over to the mobile version since all progress is saved online
4,fantastic game love playing it on the pc however running on my snine was painful even after turning all the graphic options to low or off was hoping to use this as a way to complete my dailies while away from home but in its current state i dont think its feasible really hoping the devs find a way of allowing us mobile users to reduce graphics a little more to allow for smoother gameplay maybe reduce the view distance or perhaps remove some of the grass and leaf effects on trees
3,the graphics and visuals are astonishing however before the opening players should be given the option to change the graphics setting i was not able to enjoy the opening cg due to massive lag with wifi working perfectly the controls and gameplay are spot on though having five or more enemies will slow down combat please implement a lower graphics setting so players can enjoy the game to the fullest no matter the platform
5,the graphics show how far mobile gaming has come they compare to that of a console without overheating the device or much lag the interface is quite manageable albeit it can be hard to remember what is where also there are so many mechanics it can be confusing and overwhelming on what you might want to focus on at first my main issue is that it takes a looong time to unlock many vital features but despite all this the game is certainly worth trying i enjoy this refreshing game
5,in my opinion this is the best open world mobile game taking into account the graphics the storyline the visuals the character arcs and the smooth game play experience mobile players will inevitably face some backlashes like lag heat up or game crash but from personal experience it is not so bad that one cannot play smoothly for hours moreover the in game experience is so lively and engaging and even if you do not spend money on the game it is actually really fun
5,the graphics are really smooth i have not tried the co op mode yet as my adventure rank is still low so i cannot say much at the moment the navigation is easy as you get more familiar with the game some of the tips provided are a bit confusing to understand the items need to be clicked to be picked up instead of being automatically put in the bag
5,this has been a pleasant surprise but the resin system is too unfriendly open world exploring should be slightly more rewarding this will bring in more players the cooldown of resin does not fit in with this open world besides that the soundtrack graphics and gameplay are all amazing this is coming from someone who makes an effort to complete every game on console pc
4,absolutely love genshin the storyline is great and the graphics are amazing i rated it four out of five stars because the apps takes up a lot of storage which makes the game lag when loading in new areas on a side note after the seven update my phone did not have enough space to play the game anymore and i do not have a pc to play on either however i do have a chromebook the issue is that genshin is not supported on chromebook so can the developers please make the game accessible to other devices
5,i play this on both phone and pc really fantastic open world game very similar to zelda beautiful graphics and interesting characters and enjoyable combat system gameplay its more difficult to play on phone than on pc the only downside is that while the game is fully cross play it is not fully cross save this means i cannot log in and play my phone pc account on my playstation i hope when the game is released on nintendo switch that the cross save feature is available
5,the game is great however when it was connected with my samsung ear buds live its sound effects have some litte noises but i did not have this issue when i was playing other games like two k twenty mobile or something maybe it is the problem of incompatibility and i hope there will be some improvement of the issue for the better game experience
5,the game is super satisfying and beautiful sometimes there is nothing to do reallybut that is to be expected from a platform with a lot of potential i suppose a lot of players are very upset at the mechanics which i am not sure about but i will not stop playing being quick at progressing is not the thing the company wants us to pursue but many players seem to miss this point it is the best experience ever if you are just looking to explore a new world and story also it is free
5,this turned out to be so addictive i love it you are always learning more about the storyline characters and different kinds of currency and items it is easy enough to progress through the levels but not to the point it is boring i love all the different achievements co op mode all the collections it is amazing gamelplay too not overwhelming with the controls and settings but offers all you need this is especially important to me
4,awesome game with a surprising amount of depth to it feels close to a high quality non mobile game the audio could use some work to make it feel more polished voices are too spammy in combat and music is somewhat forgettable or often not mixed well in terms of volume add controller support and allow the camera distance to be permanently set if you have any interest at all in rpgs there is nothing to lose as a free to play experience hopefully mobile games begin to go this design route
5,beyond five stars i have few very minor personal issues though it may be a bit difficult to pick up items when running it would be cool if there was an auto pickup or something when doing idle animations your feet no longer align with the terrain underneath leaving the game or even turning phone power for a little bit makes you immediately disconnect thus making you need to start any dungeon or temple all over
4,i love that this game has a breath of the wild vibe to it but a better feeling than that i would give it five stars but i feel that the performance requirements outstrip the current mobile technology for those that cant afford the brand new phones or tablets the cut scenes keep freezing and the gameplay is quite choppy i will have to get it for pc if i want to play it properly also i cant seem to find the options to change the movement style the ui size nor the options to change the vo style
4,i love the game the story is so smooth and the characters so easy to adore but i have one little complaint i deleted many apps to be able to install this one and still have ten gb free storage in my phone and still when the storyline starts it gets stuck and i can only hear the plot not see it please fix this bc i do not think it is my devices problem it is new and works perfectly i love the creators of the game tho it is amazing
5,you hit the free to play grind eventually unfortunately but this is a surprisingly good game that exceeds expectations for a legend of zelda breath of the wild clone apart from the free to play issues which are not as bad as a lot of games the biggest problem is a lot of missed potential related to multiplayer the invite system makes it very hard to find anyone who wants to play story co op and power levels differ too widely for it to make sense in many cases when even allowed
3,i loved the game utmost it gives me the real anime experience all beautiful sceneries which are well designed but the problem is that the device heats a lot even the newest one plus nine heats high battery drain it would be better if you create this game well optimised other things i have no issues everything was perfect
5,it absolutely blows my mind that a game with this level of quality is free i have already gotten hours of fun gameplay and did not need to spend a dime the game incentivizes you to explore and mess around but it does not restrict you with a recharge system or anything like that the combat is fast paced and the way you can form and plan out team compositions is unique and innovative i think this game is going to set the bar for free games down the road
4,i love it its so good and engaging the controls are simple very responsive the graphics and the views are breathtaking i absolutely love it i have minor issues sometimes with the story times where the screen freeze but i can still listen to it im not sure if is my phone or the game but to be honest does not bother me because does not happen during the game play only story times overall is an amazing game for a mobile game
5,this maybe one of the best games i ever played the graphics controls and everything however i wish there was more content in the game more quests and more accessibility to other characters to try them out and have more fun the cost of upgrading everyone is just not possible and i wish there was a messaging system with other players without going into co op mode
5,all i can say is awesome sauce this game is so much fun i love open world games and this also has a brilliant story too only a couple of things that confuse me once you get your characters it does not show what star level they are and the action buttons are too big i find myself hitting buttons constantly when i am just trying to change my views the virtual joystick needs to be up a little higher too if they could make these things adjustable the layout it would be perfect
4,this game is absolutely incredible i adore the art and gameplay even the story though very realistic on anime tropes is good and i adore the characters however i do want to bring up that at the end of the day this is a gatcha game the gatcha mechanics can be extremely frustrating and i still fully believe that the resin system needs reformed to make co op more of a staple there is also a drop off in content once you put in enough hours but i assume that will get better along the way
4,good rpg game reminds me of breath of the wild big time then witcher skyrim and sword art online honestly i am curious how the story is since i am visually comparing it to those games i just got to the first city but couldnt play anymore due to glitches and constant freezing even restarting the app and phone did not help story seems good so far four stars because constant glitching which takes away from the experience controls seem alright takes getting used to
5,it is great just the type of rpg that i have been trying to find on phones the only problem is that my phone lags a bit so this might work smoothly on a tablet instead it is a little rocky road on phones so i give it two thumbs up as games that could compete with consoles consoles should learn from example of this game instead of being platform driven this game is similar to the perfect rpg that i am thinking or creating si far all i could do is a script format
5,beautiful smooth game play immersive captivating with a good momentum it can be challenging but not overpowering you collect chatactures and weapons through a points system so always chance for change and varity cut scenes were a little shaky at first but that seems to be quickly fixed does take a beating on your phone mines been getting pretty hotz but honestly it is worth it i will update when i have gotten more familiar with it but for now it seems like a keeper
5,i was skeptical at first but this game is a lot of fun it brings together all of the fun parts of rpgs in this amazing and beautiful world the quests and characters are interesting and even endearing at times the travel system is fantastic and i love being able to go just about anywhere you can see the combat is deceptively easy at the beginning but becomes quite challenging as you progress i especially love the ability to play on my phone or pc thank you mihoyo
3,sound comes through with static making it hard to enjoy the music controls are okay for touch controls but not great touch controls on an action game never will be despite having a huge phone screen my thumbs take up too much of the screen action games on mobile should come with controller support i just cannot play anymore hands cramp up after less than an hour of gameplay i would sink tons of hours and money just add controller support it would be better for me if you would just add it to xbox
5,i never liked to play mobile games and cross platform did not seem viable to me but this game made me change my mind it plays well on mobile and pc and has a really good gradual introduction of gameplay features maybe even a bit to gradual slow but maybe that is trying to enjoy it to the max and trying to every sidequest before moving on it is just great and really well made addictive as well but that is what a good game should be and it is hard to not be tempted to play when i should work
5,voice acting could be better a little more focus on the main plot could have been great too but this game is about as close to zelda botw as you can get on a phone it is fantastic controls feel great weapon designs are great the art is amazing the mechanics are awesome the sound design and osts are great too there is little to not like in the game
3,this game is great amazing visuals and combat system i really like the grind also however the game needs more optimization fixes i have a good phone that can run this game decently however at certain times my game lags like crazy and crashes which is inconvenient because i may be near the end of a boss fight and i lose my progress
5,its got an interesting story with easy to use game mechanics the visuals are beautiful and smooth however it drains battery like crazy and you will want to make sure you have a light and airy phone case to prevent from overheating also do not forget to restart your phone after you install to refresh memory just like with any other app
4,gameplay is fun and addictive i am absolutely obsessed with this game however my only complaint is that the game continues to freeze and sometimes crash during major fights and the game will usually freeze for up to three minutes it gets really frustrating on boss levels especially the ruin guards and ley line openings please make a feature where the game will automatically pause when the app freezes
4,game played great initially when running well characters and actions are fluid however there are some performance issues some easy performance wins would be to reduce the amount of grass reduce objects visual in distance and tone down special effects i think there is just too much being rendered at the same time it also feels like the internet connection causes game lag if connection is poor the game seems to stutter this feels like a weird design choice
4,great characters gameplay and story the four star rating is for the huge file size as well as lag and frequent disconnection and reconnection from the servers our internet is quite fast so i do not understand why it happens the environment also takes a while to load especially after a long glide the lag gets too horrible sometimes that it takes time for the characters to switch and enemies to appear
5,i imagine the game is easier to play on pc or console but the mobile version is still very good the movement controls give me some problems but i feel like everything else is optimized well the graphics are nice and i do not experience any lag or framerate drops and the story world and characters are all vibrant and fun and pull me in i may end up switching over to the playstation version but i am really enjoying the android version of the game
5,this game is a must have if you enjoy story driven games with a lot of variety in abilities characters and again stories the sheer amount of side quests and commisions one can do for rewards is insane and the limited time events are just awesome though there are a few things that bug me like how i cannot go back to a previous dialog choice when talking to someone outside of a quest instead of backing out of the conversation entirely it is only minor and is not worth bumping down to a four star
4,ive only started playing genshin probably like a couple weeks or so and i absolutely love it the storyline side quests open world exploring the characters etc its just all amazing but i am having a bit of trouble with the audio and it seems like i am not the only one experiencing it the music seems to lag and its static y but when use the menu when you click on piamon next to map the audio seems fine hopefully the issue is resolved and i would love to give you guys the five stars
5,this game is gorgeous and has a nice world to explore the combat is simple but has depth to it the characters are unique and interesting i look forward to seeing what this game will add in the future and keep exploring this expanding world edit the only things that could be improved are the supplies and the resin system zero point six drop rate for five is too low for my liking word of advice do not use standard unless you are fine with any character or weapon
5,for a free to play cross platform mobile game this really goes above and beyond anything else out there in terms of playable content the controls are a bit unresponsive sometimes but for a new release it is such high quality that any complaints i have are dwarfed in the sheer amount to do and play from the engaging dialogue to the unique gameplay there is a lot going for this game i hope it stays around for years to come
5,game itself is not bad so far but it is basically unplayable on my pixel three xl it constantly freezes for a good five to ten seconds just play the game on a pc update nineteen oct twenty twenty gave it another shot and it runs smoothly in certain areas and without rain do not go to cities or else it will freeze up and rain causes lag as well still needs improvement but overall loads of fun even on single player
3,i have been playing this game since six and the gameplay graphics world building and the characters are all great however this recent update has been less pleasant since the game would often crash at first i thought the problem is my device but after hearing from my friends that they also experienced the same thing i hope the devs would fix this soon it really discouraged me to go back at the loading screen again
4,i love this game in general this game is well developed fun yet also challenging the anniversary rewards are great and i would love to see the next regions with new characters one thing though the texting thing on mobile glitches sometimes when you send the message it is still in the text box so if you are spamming the send button like i do you would send the message again it is not that big of a deal just a slight annoyance
5,as of right now this game is blowing my mind and millions of other player minds as well the graphics are on point the mechanics are refreshing and the extensive free roam is the most wonderful thing ever if there were a few things i would like to be seen added it would be the ability to dash after jumping the ability to cross save between playstation and pc or mobile
3,amazing game gripping story and well written characters with fantastic music as well the only issue at the moment is that the system requirements which are way too high given that only a small amount of mobile players actually have premium phones that can run this game smoothly it is really annoying everytime you get to a stormterror cutscene or fight you cannot see anything and you will end up exhausting all your items trying to stay alive but failing anyway please optimize your game better
4,the game is absolutely amazing great graphics interesting storyline amazing characters and awesome gameplay although it eats up so much of your storage unless you have enough space on your device consider if you are willing to free up eight gb plus the download time in game is horrible so pros and cons i love this game kinda forced to by my brain after putting so much effort in to setting it up to be honest but still amazing worthwhile for me
3,the game is very good but the missing controller support on android is a no go for a game like this the touch control is not that bad but the combat system need a controller for the whole fun if you add a native controller support for android i will change to five stars i did not have any lags the graphics are very nice the game runs smooth played on oneplus seven pro partially with highest or middle graphics to play longer with battery
5,so far this is easily the best all around mobile game i have played it is beautiful to play full voice over easy controls and rewarding to explore so far it appears to be true open world which many other games claim but cannot deliver you control all the action and can take your time the combat is smooth and challenging enough to keep you engaged and the chance at collectibles and hidden chests keeps you wanting to see what is over that next hill bravo
3,the art style quests characters lore storyline and everything is truly exceptional but i had to stop playing because of how bigger the size of the app gets every update it would be better if somehow we can delete the files or resources of the previous quests that we have finished and will not need but overall it is a great game
5,honestly great been playing for several months now i am mostly housebound due to disability and this game makes a lot of days more bearable and fun i spend a fiver a month on the extra primos and that is about it but you do not have to spend money to be able to progress love exploring love the story love the vibe hidden treasures making food fishing and more main downside is the amount of space it takes up i had to get a memory card for everything else
5,honestly it is a miracle this game can even exist on phones you can tell this was made by devs who care about the user experience everything about this is high quality the music the graphics the story the controls the ui the vo the localization with a few exceptions everything comes together to really set a new bar for what games can be on mobile that are not just ports truly astounded keep up the work between this and honkai mihoyo is now definitely on my radar
5,my second best game i have every played nothing more to say its amazing one rlly annoying thing if i go out of the app just for a millisecond it resets the app i have to login and click play again that is super annoying but i am more of a pc player anyways still if yall can fix that it would be amazing edit please just add controller support for mobile i really need it and it should not be that hard right
5,i just love the fact that this is a full console game thats working perfectly on my midrange aseventy the game itself is awesome immersive and detailed combat system is great but could use some refinement the only thing that is a little bit annoying is how the camera moves around on it is own during a fight since i am only using a touch screen not a joystic it is hard to keep adjusting the camera mid fight
4,the new patch will no longer let me log in i am stuck on the download page and have no idea what to do with this i really do love this game the stories are incredible the character designs are impeccable and the events are so fun however it can become really competitive as once you grow your worlds levels it gets pretty hard and can get very annoying otherwise i love the game and i am very invested even when it gets hard i simply keep coming back i swear it is a addictive lol
3,hello i recently started playing genshin impact again i love the architectural visual styles a lot the buildings and the world is very beutiful however i do have some wishes for the game for it to truly be amazing in my opinion i would like to see more characters with varied skin tones there is not a lot of that which kind of sucks but i also think it would be cool to have a character like a playable hillichurl some more out there character designs and ideas it would add some needed variation
3,this game is great the gameplay is excellent and if your phone cannot handle it you can change the graphics settings however it consumes a lot of storage space and it is extremely difficult to obtain your favorite characters without spending hours on quest and farming for chest furthermore unlike ios an android phone like mine cannot use controllers i need to spend five minutes getting honest feedback so please fix the problem i encountered and i would like to learn more about the game
5,i love this game it is litterally one of my favorite games in the world but there is one thing i play on computer i have a touchpad and a physical mouse i adjusted the sensitivity but genshin impact is still really slow with my mouse which affects my archery and how quick i can turn my screen i have tried settings but they only partly helped it is still really slow with my mouse i do enjoy the game though and i cant wait for future updates
5,excellent game however i found i cannot play this game on my phone pixel three because the frame rate is so bad even at low settings it works perfectly on both my ipad and pc so that is not a huge problem it looks better on them anyway and i think it is the best android game of twenty twenty hands down full of content and hidden locations full voiced cutscenes epic boss fights yeah it is great
2,honestly one of the best rpg mobile games i found i live the story and the characters and animation i would give it a higher rating if it was not for the fact that the game keeps crashing i got to level six then as i would run or fight normal enemies it would start to freeze up and crash i tried cleaning my phone cache and made more space for the game i even uninstalled and installed again but it continues to crash so i just gave it and finally uninstalled it completely
4,decent device recommended but not unplayable on a lower performance platform make sure you have six or so gb space in your storage drains battery pretty quickly especially on higher settings otherwise such a game being available to mobile is impressive visuals and combat are great rich storyline with complete and passionate voicing requires you to level up a bit before being able to play with friends
5,congrats for winning in the best mobile games the game is enjoyable the overall gameplay and the game itself is excellent i will highly recommend this game to my friends however the game runs smoothly at first but after thirty minutes it starts to slow down this happens every time i play i suggest to have a setting that decreases or increases your render distance we appreciate the view of dragonspine from liyue but it is not necessary to view if you are surrounded by treasure hoarders a slider of render distance might help our gameplay much smoother and better i believe this change or related change will get better reviews of the game i hope you understand congratulations
4,fun and great game to play have been playing since the beginning and it is an amazing open world adventure wish the characters were more customizable but i still love the characters in the story but having major bugs with the game now i sent an email to customer service no reply edit new update fixes the bugs so i can play again but i missed out on so many quests and rewards raised my rating to four stars
5,if you came for the gacha look elsewhere i will never appreciate a system with items and units in the same pulls to muddy the chances of getting new characters plus the drop rates are bad to begin with however if you are looking for a well voiced beautifully crafted experience with a world full of nuance and many ideas inspired by an amazing ip then you have come to the right place there is a lot to explore barely even out of the tutorial and there is still so much more to find
5,i usually do not write reviews on mobile games but this game is an exception the graphics are wonderful and the uniqueness crafted into every piece of chunk in the whole map is spectacular to some degree even rivaling some pc games the connection is good enough for other players the game would bug out but that is probably due to device issues or bugs that the game hasnt fixed yet overall it is one of the most open world games in mobile with more content to come in the future
5,to start things off i am instantly met with fantastic and soothing audio while the game finishes installing the open world farming concept is exactly the way i see in anime that i have always yearned for some items have mentioned co op but so far this seems to be a single player only game its already at the top of the list of favorites but it would skyrocket if it turns out to be an on line server type game either way still love it
4,it is mostly wonderful the animation is beautiful and it has a great story my only issues are some bugs with the visuals and some of the mechanics outside of the main city most of the ground turns black making it harder to find things you would get from battles and such when it comes to mechanics it can be difficult to continuously move using the joystick and control while gliding is a bit touchy as well otherwise a fantastic game that doesnt make spending money the main goal
5,one of the most fun mobile games i have played runs super smooth on galaxy s ten e i love the variety of character abilities and play styles it is great to have cross platform so i can also play on pc controls are significantly easier on pc to dodge jump backwards off a ledge then glide back towards it or maintain enemies in camera mobile works well you just will not ever be as adept without a keyboard mouse it is fun for a couple hours then take a break so you do not burnout
3,first time i downloaded this everything was working perfectly however after the latest update i have been experiencing so many bugs example sometimes the commissions locations do not appear in my map when i enlarge it so i could navigate there were also times when i play co op the other persons character just glitches through the screen hoping for a better experience in the next update
4,the game is overall very fun i love the set up and i think it is a fun challenging addicting game my one main problem is the security factors i think that it would be much safer if the game had a two step authentication system i have lost my account multiple times over and over again i now do not play on mobile and mainly play on playstation you should also let the players bring over accounts from different devices i had to restart my game just to play on playstation other than this it is good
5,this game is just perfect the characters are so beautiful and have beautiful animations i really like the story and how it is not only put through words but also cut scenes i have been obsessed since day and barely took any breaks the puzzles and hidden teleport waypoints are really annoying but it also makes it pretty interesting recommend the game it is easy to understand most of the things
4,one star is missing because of one gigantic problem is that the left analog virtual joystick does not appear where you touch instead it is fixed into one position which makes for a lotta errors in a game with such precision required this is unacceptable the modern virtual joystick appears where you touch and then you move your finger in a direction to move this fixed analog feels very primitive otherwise this game is a marvel get it
3,mihoyos third venture is certainly ambitious and genshin impact is definitely on the high end of quality the gacha system while enticing is optional for anything except the hardest of challenges the game world is very pretty to look at and the combat has some clever tricks to encourage wild experimentation unfortunately the controls do not follow through precision issues and an overloaded ui makes the mobile version a hard sell optimally play on pc touch controls just do not cut it
5,i have tried a lot of mobile games and i am going out of my way to rate this the definitive open world rpg experience available on a phone the graphics and soundtrack are stunning and unlike those fancy but effectively unplayable pc mmo ports this is made for single player and intuitive touch controls the world is a bit girlish and difficulty rather on the casual side but there is so much love and beauty in this game that this actually makes it all the more enjoyable to explore recommend
3,i liked the graphics and the character design however it is very difficult to navigate the game on a mobile phone the way you have to navigate your phone screen in order to see enemies or to complete tasks so you can go on missions makes it hard to enjoy the game definitely a much better experience on the playstation versus a phone so if you have one you would be much better off playing it that way my brother chose that option and it is far more enjoyable since navigation is easier to do
3,gameplay is good and the quests are great but the game is truly amazing if you have a phone that has larger storage and is more suited for games that take up battery the game should be able to function much better and not lag so much when you are on low graphics and have a bad ping signal overall the game is great but it would be nice if the game were smoother when a player is using low graphics than when it is on a higher graphic setting to save battery and the amount of lag that happens
4,the foremost issues i face is storage however that is the nature of well made games the second issue is that it takes over eight hours to load at first this is quite irksome but i am not sure that is a problem that can be fixed otherwise the game is wonderful lots of gameplay can keep you entertained for a while and i really love the way the multiplayer function works
2,game looks lovely controls need work i did not get passed the tutorial as i had much difficulty getting used to the controls tried searching the options for a way to invert the on screen controls and realized that genshin impacts devs had not thought of this i will wait for a while and hope such a rudimentary option gets included in the next update
5,i love genshin impact but still it has it is own advantages and disadvantages first it is beautiful game the design of landscapes and characters is amazing second stories of even nps characters are cute and touching third there are many things to do daily tasks different events a lot of boses and dungeons to improve your playing skills however as a pc player it is hard for me to play on the mobile the graphic on the mobile version is lower and the controller is more complicated
5,this game is very addicting indeed it is free and all and has amazing characters places animations voices music and cut scenes the only thing is when i update it it takes half of my storage rather than that everything is very addicting the characters gameplay and everything really i cannot really say anything else and i do not really have any problems with it either but it is a very amazing game and i hope for the future updates and character releases
3,beautiful game absolutely stunning slightly laggy the only reason i gave a three star review is because of the loading time it took me five hours to get into the game play but eventually the loading stops and it was great but then my screen went black and i couldnt do anything and the music was breaking please fix this and i most likely will set the review at five stars
5,this one game is so great i love it the only thing that is the cutscenes are not skippable talking about non skippable it consumes some storage and battery throughout the process cutscenes it also lags somehow if we then have an option to skip it perhaps there should also be some titles before the cutscene starts so we would be able to browse it instead on reliable sources anyways this game is immersive
5,not at all what i was expecting pleasantly surprised the graphics are fantastic as is the soundtrack i love the ability to switch between characters as this gives you more variety in play the gliding and free running aspects are second to none there are not any mobile games out there that achieve what genshin has achieved not money hungry game just hours of fun whats not to like
3,graphically this game does not go well with the mobile platform the cutscene animation freezes while the audio continues the graphics for the characters are choppy once you begin any movement controls work well and the menus are similar to botw i am sure the story is great but the first five seconds into the game and the cutscene froze it did not catch up to the audio until it is time to choose either the male of female character to play as five gb download size is massive load screens suck
4,game play feels very familiar if you have played zelda botw but by no means are these the same i would give five stars for sure if the cinematics did not freeze up but at least it still moves onto the game after the cinematics allotted length also climbing is a bit off at times it will refuse to climb some objects or places unless my camera is perfectly aligned with it then at other times i am climbing a wall before i knew it and lost what i was chasing around the corner still an awesome game
3,i love and enjoyed this since it was launched however the only problem i have is the stuttering graphics especially on cutscenes as much as i enjoyed playing i have since stopped because each update means more memory space and i have changed four phones with high end spec features and still have trouble with the graphics sad to say overbloated variations is what will be your downfall just saying thanks
3,s ultra restart fixed the issue with crashing this is a great game overall but it needs refinement it is not mature in terms of well thought mechanics and systems its greedy in a sense because it forces you to invest way too much time and or money for so little return whether it be resources materials or properly animated or entertaining stories it is also pretty bad for new players since you miss out on so many events and weapons still fun overall and beautiful design
5,i really like it no necessary purchases to play nor auto navigation and auto fight lots of storyline that makes senses and additional quests to help you level properly and the graphics are amazing i am very surprised at how much i am enjoying this game i highly recommend this game if you have a lot of free time or just want to try out a new rpg via mobile
5,incredible game with amazing graphism landscapes and musics though the plot is not the best it is always a pleasure to play it the characters are well designed and well written the only problem i found is the storage for phone users the game needs more than tengb which is a lot i advice playing it on playstation or computer pc because of this otherwise i highly recommend this game
3,the graphics and different characters are amazing every character and quest are unique this is one of the games you can free play and spend hours on i am addicted to this game edit one thing i would change is the fact that you need such a good ping to play even when you are on single player mode i can barely play now because i keep getting teleported to the beginning of a quest
4,this game is great i play it on mobile and my only issue is there is not enough room for the attack controls and and using the empty space to rotate the camera so many times i hot the damn attack button when i am just trying to turn the god damn camera oh and i guess the camera angles a lot of the time i think its pinned to close to the character and it causes a bunch of bad angles especially during battles but other than that it is bloody brilliant i recommend it to anyone who likes rpgs
4,beautiful music visuals and voice acting i loved this on the console and pc and the mobile experience is surprisingly good the game file is massive i do not play it on mobile anymore i think the games biggest weakness is its reliance on the gacha system the characters are mostly well designed at least until sumerus but the story seems to showcase these new characters rather than provide satisfying progression of the plot good enough for some but not enough to keep me ty tho
5,i have a pretty new phone with one hundred gb of storage but after a full days worth of downloading the frame rate is so bad it is actually just me looking at standstill images with my character moving a foot or two every so often edit after a few years i finally got it working on another device my pc and am having tons of fun it is a shame that i cannot get the wings of companionship anymore since my account was created more than a year before being able to play without crashing
3,it is as everyone say the animation is good and even the voice actors are doing a great job the scenery is absolutely stunning though there is only one thing making me enjoy fully and that is lag the character suddenly freezes and then the game crashes maybe it is just my phone that cant handle it all though the game still deserves a star from me
4,so far i am loving this game this is a console level video game experience on my phone and the shop hasnt been intrusive enough to make me feel like i am forced to spend money to enjoy myself my only problem so far is that some times the game boots up in portrait mode instead of landscape and i have to restart multiple times to change it back if this can be fixed thisll be a five star game for me
4,the music the world the graphics everything is beautiful and goes so well together there is a story but it does not get showed down your throat instead you can choose yourself to learn more about the characters books foods enemies and weapons everything just goes so well exept the cutsenes and button placement playing this on a phone with good internet connection the cutsenes will not work at all the video will not play and the adio lags
4,i love this game sure it can get a little boring when you have been playing for an year but it is still fun there is a lot you can do but i do have some minuses first of all i think primogems are way too hard to get sometimes there might be good events and all but otherwise it is almost impossible to get many without spending money and also it takes way too much storage on phone that is why i play it on playstation
3,i love this game so much but the controls on mobile are really difficult they take up a large portion of the screen so i hit things accidentally die because of it or lose animals it is the only frustrating part but impacts gameplay significantly so that is why i have it stars the rest of the game is amazing and beautiful the story is engaging and i absolutely love it and cannot wait for it to come out on switch wish this would release to xbox
2,music is awesome graphical style and design is also lovely however gameplay is mostly not that interesting and quite often rich of repeating the same actions over and over again monetization model is also not great it is quite awful and kind of a style for games like that even more the map is still in development and optimization became worse since two point zero update i cannot recommend genshin if you are not ready to pay a lot of money to make it fun to play or if you are aint willing to grind
4,this is a great game the development team should be proud my biggest issues with the game are the joystick placement to move the character should adjust to where the player first puts their finger then the player can drag from that new location many other apps have this feature and its is a quality of life improvement the app needs controller support the game is available on playstation so just let those with a playstation or xbox controller use that interface other than that great work
2,the game is really gorgeous and has good exploration and some other fun features however awful and highly unstable performance along with constant disconnections make it impossible to enjoy after the november update the stability and performance are momentarily better and less catastrophic e g reconnections are short and less frequent but the situation quickly decays indicating perhaps a memory leak please continue to build on the progress you have made by fixing the disconnections
4,love the open world maps and the character attack moves missions are interesting but like every game with missions gets a bit repetitive my only complaint about an otherwise beautiful game is the gotcha system for heroes i was lucky to get a qiqi my first week playing but after about one hundred attempts i gave up trying to get another one to level her up i do not mind spending money but the odds are too low and with new characters added all the time the odds just seem to get worse
3,i would say this is the best open world game anyone can ever find on android in twenty twenty neat graphics character details physics and it is something that will just easily keep anyone hooked however i see the ping issues also the game screen freezes on pc and the game is still running in the background i can move character but the screen is frozen after reaching liyue game is quite laggy even in phone have to force stop most of the times need more optimisation for low end devices and bug fix
5,where do i start this game is amazing it has a nice and interesting storyline cool characters and honestly a pretty well made gacha game what i do not like is the lag for example if i am doing a quest and fighting something my whole screen suddenly freezes it would be nice if the creators would fix this but overall it is a pretty well made game
5,genshin impact is one of my favorite games overall there is so much to do the storyline is simply amazing and it really pulled me in when i started from building characters to exploring the world the possibilities are pretty ranged and the co op system is very cool i have met a lot of people throughout the year of playing and i am extremely satisfied you will need to put in a lot of time and effort to progress since the quests ex archon quests story quests hangouts are really long
5,beautiful graphics a perfect eye candy immersive background music and sfx comfortable controls user friendly interface easy to learn great physics and logic and whatnot i have never seen anything like this before very innovative ten over ten i hope spending hours of playing and grinding is still better than pay to win though because that makes the game worth playing and earning achievements over time
4,i love the game everything from storyline graphics to game play only issue i have is that i wish i could use my bluetooth keyboard to play it i have played on computer and prefer the controls though it shows the option to chance input you cannot actually change it to keyboard or controller other than that amazing game highly recommend it
4,overall it is an amazing game but there are a few bugs and not much to do in co op it glitches out sometimes when you are fighting and the screen stays frozen the story is great and all the characters are fine as well but since the graphics are amazing it takes up a lot of space so it is just better to play on pc there is a lot to explore and to unlock on the map using the gacha is kinda worth using money on but you might end up only getting weak weapons
5,great controls great gameplay great progression flow great story great characters great world the game is carefully crafted for an exquisite balance i can say it is a reflection of the purest forms of art that resonate with the human soul it is like your favorite books and your favorite songs all in one now it has a few problems monetization being the worst absolutely ridiculous scheme you would have better odds of getting a character by selling your soul to a devil ad astra abyssosque
5,my experience this far has been enjoyable i love the art style and character voices interaction gameplay on mobile has been easy to use and the experience on pc is just as enjoyable wishing seems a little hazy during the early game music is enjoyable and flows from exploration to combat and back again with excellent transitions create your account before you login with a google account if you want any sort of cross save functionality that was not clear so i ended up starting over on pc
4,one of the best games i ever played the graphic art lore gameplay and even music are great collecting and building characters is really fun and exciting the support is helpful and fast the only reason why i do not give a five star rating is the rng system of artifact is too painful even if we put so much efforts the chances of getting a good artifact is too low besides our main character the traveler deserves lot of free skins
4,my only gripe it is missing controller support for android beautiful game with tons to do as well as co op and an engaging battle system story and voice acting is good it can be frustrating to move and dodge exactly the way you would like which is where controller support comes in but unfortunately that feature is limited to ios at the moment that is the only thing keeping it from a prefect score you will not regret downloading this game
4,the game and story are amazing the graphics are top quality the characters are easy to like in many different ways and the lore is glorious i do have a few issues with the wishing system though it takes so long to save up for characters and if you get them you have to make sure you have a good weapon for them usually at least a four star and the amount of primogems that are available against the amount that you need to have in order to have a chance at getting the character are very unfair
5,genshin impact was a surprise it is an openworld adventure game that was beyond what i have expected people say that this game is a direct rip off of the legend of zelda breath of the wild but id say otherwise the graphics are console level and the story is top quality however the controls are a little annoying and the option to move and customise the controls would greatly help anyways this game is spectacular and one of the best in years thank you for reading and thank you mihoyo
5,decided to give this game a try after seeing multiple post about how good the game was at the beginning i thought just another anime ish cartoon ish type of game and thought that after playing it for days it would get boring however that was not the case the graphics are impressive the story is really good and there is a lot to do i do not consider it pw because you can get primogem easily by completing achievments and exchanging for other usefull equipment items great game
5,this is by far my favourite game i love the storyline the places the characters the design the only issue is that genshin is not at all new player friendly if you were to start playing now four i think it would be overwhelming mostly because in order to level up a character you need certain resources from places that could take a long time to unlock and you should not rush other than that i really really enjoy genshin
3,do not get me wrong i love this game and used to be obsessed with it but now i cannot even play it due to it crashing everytime i start it my phone is absolutely fine so i cannot point it onto that i can barely get past the loading screen and when i do it crashes as soon as everything starts loading the one time i have gotten it to get past these screens was when i restarted the app at least five times and then it crashed as soon as i teleported please fix this issue i want to play again
5,so far best mobile game i have played in years only spent about six seven hours in the game so far and i already plan to play for the forseeable future no in your face monetary options the game runs smooth the combat is fun and easy to pick up and i appreciate the party implementation the amount of freedom they give you is amazing from climbing mountains to using a freaking glider and no limit on exploration as to what i have seen so far highly recommend
4,amazing game i like the colours the vibe the style and story probably not the first time you guys heard this but its just that the lack of content maybe its because some story quests are too short and give too little rewards the resin system feels too little or too low another would be the events are a little boring also anothe problem would be chest respawns the problem is that they dont
5,game looks and plays beautifully but my audio stops working after hour of game play i have repeatedly re installed the game to temporarily fix the issue but the audio goes mute after hour again i am using a flagship device please revert as i need this fixed i have made in game purchases i want the complete experience
4,overall great game the graphics are beautiful the characters are pretty cool the world is just masterfully built however i have my complaints to start off the resin system is atrocious workable but atrocious its constantly just trying to stay afloat and running out very quickly the gameplay gets extremely repetitive ar twenty plus however that is understandable as only two of the seven over eight regions have been released so the other content is gonna take a bit seriously tho the resin system is bad
4,this is one if the most visually impressive mobile games i have ever played its a really well put together story and the combat is very smooth the one thing that slightly bugs me as a zelda fan is that this is blatantly a copy of breath of the wild the game mechanics shrines temples enemies etc are basically ripped right from botw what saves the game is that it is a great copy so it a does not bug me much because its so fun to play and feels like playing botw on mobile which is great
5,i am very pleased with my experience thus far high points for me the gamplay is fun in particular exploring and combat the aesthetic is beautiful the story premise is promising minor low points for me there are occasionally moments of lag but i am not sure if it is the games fault the joystick control is fixed in place unlike other games where the joystick centers on where my thumb or finger initially touches the screen it is not bad but takes getting used to
5,it is literally ripping off the mechanics of legend of zelda breath of the wild same sparkly items same running insects same stamina same climbing sprinting same encampments and crates and boxes little puzzles and challenges and i hate that i love it but the story is actually intriguing the voice actors are good the animation is wonderful it is only been like four days and it is already on the app store in adventure only thing i hate you cannot leave the app for seconds or it closes
5,definitely the best free online game i have ever played everything about it is amazing the graphics are just amazing and this game definitely deserves more attention and support no problem with the game so far as long as you have a good phone or pc but i do have request though i wish that every month or two the chests except luxurious will reset i hope your character can hang out date with some of the npc or the playable characters just for fun and more storyline
4,overall the gameplay is fantastic the fighting mechanics is so well polished and unique good storyline good voice acting soundtracks etc what i do not like about it is the resin system and the way on how you level up your characters currently i am arfour i played for a month now after reaching ar thirthy and when you have maxed all statues and collected all chests there nothing much to do anymore because if you need to progress you need resins which is very slow to regenerate
2,great game i play it on pc all the time the android version had an extreme oversight though in that there is absolutely no controller support the drop down to change from touchscreen to something else is there but nothing shows up honestly pretty disappointed by that because the touchscreen controls are really bad will update if they ever change this but for now i am sticking to pc
4,i really enjoy this game hard to believe i get the same amount of content as the console version on mobile i only wish there was controller support for the android version of this game it is not easy to fighting tough enemies with the screen controls other than that the soundtrack graphics and story and characters make this a great overall experience
5,this game is one of my favorite games of all time it includes open world experience which is something most people including me love it is an rpg so we get to level up our characters through work which i find very entertaining the design is incredible and so is the music i reccommend this game to everyone the plot is incredibly thrilling and funny a small piece of feedback is the resin it is not that the cap should be increased as it will take longer but the resin regen overall five
4,this game is overall amazing the graphics are great and the character designs are stunning the one problem i have had with it is having the game overheat my phone ipad depending what i am playing on and the game also tends to crash every hour or so the graphics and good quality make up for it though exceeded my expectations for a free game
4,the game is pure eye candy and a joy to play for newcomers veteran players however have slim pickings there is not a meaningful amount of late game content you are really only left with daily commissions and bi monthly abyss resets there is also a major lack of usability settings on all platforms such as an unlimited fps option more granular resolution options as well as gamepad support on android addressing these issues and better communication would go a long way for the game
5,incredible i am not sure what i was expecting when downloading this game but it has exceeded every expectation my highlights immersive story gorgeous character and world design huge open world map with loads to discover genshin impact plays much more like a console game than a mobile game while there are in app purchases they are completely optional i actually cannot believe how many hours i have played so far without making a dent and completely free at that i highly recommend
5,literally the best game ever i started playing it for the botw esque game play but quickly realized that this is far more than a simple copy and paste the graphics are stunning characters are well fleshed out and developed and the story is complex and gripping it combines strategy action and exploring in a masterful way that keeps me coming back the gacha system can be annoying but it makes getting special characters all the more rewarding tl dr get this game now
5,absolutely love the game the characters story line quests and the graphics are absolutely beyond my expectations it is certainly one of my favourite games of course its a different experience for everyone and unfortunately you will need alot of storage space for this which means it can run a bit slow at times probably just means you need to free up some room but otherwise i am in love with this gameten over tenrecommend
4,straight forward amazin but i never played such a large game in mobile i have a four gb ramthis will not provide stability to most of the phones usedeventhough it works somewhat for example the dragon cannot be seen while i play it glitches and crashes after five mins or so love the character development environment gameplay add options to custom the gamepads other than that the game is legit love it hoping for improvements in the next update
4,the game is super fun and the plot is intriguing i enjoy the colorful cast of characters as well as the aspect of having your own home amd decorating it as you see fit if i had one complaint it be that the system of getting new characters is a bit hard but not enough to really dissuade me from playing or from trying again i was kinda saddened to see we couldnt get clothes from other regions for the traveler but it is a small nitpick not a real problem
4,the game is great storyline is amazing graphics is outstanding minor issues and bugs but that is okay for a new game my issue is the bug i encountered on stormbearer point i fell off the cliff and tried to open my adventure book to locate my next boss but the game glitched and i was stuck unable to do anything for awhile hope this bug gets fixed other than that this is an really great game
2,i am not seeing any change whatsoever after a year and a half of the games release sadly the resin lock makes artifacts too hard to farm and it is even more frustrating that they are so random it is hard to level up all the characters you want as well maybe if they were a bit more generous and gave out more fragile resin from quests and events or hell even as an abyss reward the experience would be better it is a shame because the world building is very nice
5,it is an anime style version of zelda breath of the wild i enjoy it because i love the cute and pretty art style and i loved the playstyle of breath of the wild lots of fun and you do not need to spend money to get far in the game i like that you can play on both pc and mobile for days when i am too lazy to set up my computer i have a very old pc that takes a bit to start running only critique is i wish there was more multiplayer things to do most quests cannot be done in multiplayer
4,i was skeptical at first but i fell in love with this game right away but i am a mobile player and the controls and camera are just not as friendly for us i currently do not have any archer characters in my party ever because it is too easy to die while aiming due to having to adjust the camera constantly with no fine movement controls also the audio is crackling and sounds really distorted following the latest android samsung software update please fix this i love it overall
5,very engaging love the game but like most games the main storyline gets a bit grindy and you must be at a certain level to progress at certain parts this is mitigated by having a menu that will plot a bosses location on the map that has an item you need i think they should increase the amount of resin you can hold at once otherwise it takes forever to get all the items
4,the cutscenes lag like no tomorrow and occasionally the game crashes itself but overall i greatly enjoy it my biggest complaints are that for mobile users like myself catching critters is a pain and aimed mode is buggy as all heck and is overall inefficient to use archons save you if there is a timed archery challenge that stated it is a very fun game with dynamic characters and interesting plot lines and i cannot wait for the next story installment
5,the game and story is fun and addicting but once you are done with all of the quests in the game there is basically nothing left to do it is still good though the play style of each and every character is unique and the music choice is calm and relaxing it is soothing to listen to i love it the map is massive and there is tons of chests to get no problems in the game so far in my opinion pretty fun and addicting at the same time i will continue supporting this company in the future
5,all in all one of the best games i have ever played best story graphics designs scenery character and many more my only problem is that in my device oppo aninefour there are no damage number and the freeze reaction at water body is not visible i do not know if it is on the device or in the game system but if it is in the game system i hope it will be fixed thank you thank you
5,loving it the graphics are amazing the story plot is engaging all in game missions and other activities are not repetitive the voice actors characters are just so well rounded finally you can do whatever u want while playing tbh explore cook mine hunt help people by doing random quests get to know the city and teyvat in general read books farm etc last thing the animation is just so smooth and pretty i cannot say enough about genshin it is everything i wanted in a game
5,right off the bat the game looks like a high end indie game made for pc which had me a little worried at first since my experience with third person mobile games are not the best this game beats all of them and then some it runs so smoothly on my relatively cheap android phone no internet problems here though connectivity does seem to be a problem for others i have yet to experience it storywise it is fine the voiceacting is superb though and makes up for what the story lacks
5,this a a true aaa game but free and on mobile the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is fun and plentiful the characters and enemies are varied and interesting this game has it all one of my favorites of all time and the two acts and regions in the game are only maybe twenty percent of whats to come the gotcha system is a little intense and kind of a rip off if im being honest but i love it anyway eight over five keep up the great work
2,the game graphics and combat system is great however the adventure rank requirements for thr next missions are very annoying not only that but obtaining primogems and getting good characters takes too much time that not a lot of people have the drop rates for the heroes are extremely low i spent fifty and got absolutely nothing good in return now i only play this game at least once a week for at least five minutes
5,it is a good game i will not lie i have been playing it for a couple weeks but eighty of the gameplay is traveling yes you can teleport but you will not collect any items if you do that walking is really slow and running is limited it would be nice if we could ride something like horses or an original animal also dying in water is the worst could we use boats or something else
5,this is by far the best rpg for mobile i have ever playedten over tengraphics gameplay story characters style and overall user friendly to get into it from the get go my and only complaint so far is not being able to use a controller touch controls are superb so no issues i am old school i guess and still like the choice and preference of using a controller my hope is that option becomes available in the near future as well as it being released to all gaming consoles
4,this game is a must play the graphics are clean and controls are simple enough the reason why i gave four stars is that your phone quickly gets hot and the battery drains fast there is also some server lag if you go though an area with lots going on like cities i have only have played for an hour so i will edit my review once i experience more of the game
3,great game and has alot of potential the only concern is how hot my phone honor twenty gets while playing i have reduced the graphics and the fps to try to minimise this unfortunately no change so i can only play in short increments which defeats the point of playing if the techs can find a way to put less strain on our devices the five start it would be
5,i love this game with all my heart the story the graphics the gameplay the gatcha system may be flawed at times but by all means it is not an unfair game to free to play players exploring the map is amazing every update in regions is fantastic and exciting however it is a pretty time consuming game and it is very heavy on the phone last time i had it installed i basically had to delete everything else and the memory was still low
4,great game i enjoy playing it alot i just have one issue whit the new event misty dungeon please make it so that enemies cannot get you stuck in walls it has happened multiple times and every time iv been pushed against a wall an enemy comes and somehow manages to stand below me while i get pushed in the air and stuck in a wall the worst part is that the only way to get out is for the enemy to move so i can get on the ground again but they just refuse to move please fix this problem
4,beautiful game from one look it is just another fantasy rpg but the story is actually very entertaining and the game mechanics have features that do not exist in any another rpg you will see what i mean the only issue i have is with the aiming i find it hard to position my crosshair carefully as the screen is very wobbly would you please add an aim assist feature the helps players find their targets slightly without being an aimbot thanks
5,redownloaded after a while and still one of the best games for mobile story is still amazing tho it runs out of story content really really fast but for me the combat is kinda shallow i also noticed there is always a stutter from time to time and most apparent during combat it does not matter whats the graphical setting the frame will always stutter on occasion hope it will be fixed soon pls and tq midsummer isle event is super duper fun the exploration puzzle solving was the best part
5,i have had a great experience with the game the story is great the way you grind for resources is great the graphics etc basically everything is great except things my phone heats up to dangerously high temperatures when playing it goes as high as fifty eight°c it is insane that is right where a phone battery can combust randomly i am using a redmagic six pro with the cooler and yet it heats up so much game drops frames as low as fps the censoring is very useless and unnecessary
4,the graphics gameplay and characters are all exceptional the music is perfect however the developers should really find a way to make the artifact rng a lot less brutal it is utterly ridiculous to spend months in a single domain in the hopes of getting decent artifacts at the very least i love the game and i do not mind spending money on characters that i really want to get but the repetitively merciless rng on artifact farming sometimes takes away the fun and enjoyment from the game
5,i do really like this game i just wish it did not have to take up so much space it can be very laggy at times during any scene with the dragon in mondstat it would constantly flash random colors of blue and purple because of how badly it affects my storage and how poorly it runs on mobile i had to delete it overall pretty good based on what i have seen if these problems can be resolved i would give it another try
4,this game is gorgeous and fun and so easy to lose track of time playing i get really sucked into the world it does take up a lot of space but i feel it is absolutely worth it i have it in my phone and on my playstation though playing on mobile can be really tricky at times i recently learned i can connect a bluetooth controller to my phone but there is no setting on mobile for a controller option
5,it is incredible it has a lot of features found in the legend of zelda breath of the wild so it is quite enjoyable you can explore the world come across monsters pick up things like fruit that you find hunt animals etc the graphics are breathtaking as well and unlike a lot of games similar to this the dialogue is easy to understand and isnt broken english its obvious a ton of effort was put into this game but it isnt a game you should be getting if you have a slow device
5,a great free world experience with many things to do vast map to explore many quest to do the graphics is great but there is some refinement issue with certain not so smooth experience if combo attacks have been given then that would have been great yet the attacks are on par there is some issue in item pickup with late response and delayed command which can be improved with coming updates good recommendation
5,extremely fun amazing story unbelievable graphics the only problem but might only be my internet or phone is that it lags nonstop which makes it much harder to kill and climb move around the stamina and damage taken still go at normal speed but movement speed is limited the skill cooldowns also goes much slower but time challenges go at regular speed that makes the challenges almost impossible if you can fix it this game would literally be perfect otherwise i still recommend ninety nine ninety nine
5,well speaking of mmorpg i have played many games so far but genshin impact attracts me the most the texture and gameplay is smooth enough to be played in a fair and side this games color contrast and graphics are beyond and to be available in mobile its a big deal we got there but me and my friends have found many bugs on the list hope it will be fixed soon
5,absolutely gorgeous although my phone is quite old and is not able to support the cutscenes it lags quite a bit i am still very happy with this game it takes up a lot of space but the graphics make up for it the game plays beautifully on your phone for main archon quests of course some boss quests and challenges are better played on pc but that does not mean you cannot have fun on mobile all in all a breath taking experience that i still love
5,it is the newest best game i have ever played first off the artstyle and the world looks real great i am pretty sure that was hard work paying off second was the characters their voice and their personalities and lastly the game itself was great and wholesome best game in a long waited while edit the update is great we get to see a new story and the continuasion of the archon problem but i really want to find a way to redo missions and cutscenes without having rewards is that possible
4,good game but it takes way to long to start also the downloading of all the things that it needs takes hours and if for some reason it stops then it have to do the downloading from the start due to the very slow way for the game to start i have not been able to play much but from what i have played is one of the most amazing games combining rpgs and gachas so i nevertheless enjoyed the game i do not know if the problems i mentioned only happened to me if so it is ok but pls fix them thanks
2,this game clearly has a lot of heart put into it with what could be an interesting plot and interesting characters but the main story quest is such a bore with hours and hours of unskippable dialogue that all seem to amount to the same thing and little actual gameplay in comparison sometimes you are forced to do character quests in addition which also have way more dialogue than necessary if there was a skip button to skip entire scenes maybe it would be a bit better
5,love the game the music scenery and graphics are incredible for a free game i am yet to spend a penny on wishes etc and still have great characters that have all progressed if you are willing to put the time in which is made easier by the fun gameplay and great graphics then you will be able to have loads of fun without paying
3,the prices could be adapted to each country reality in brazil the prices are really high in comparison to other countries like usa it needs more attention so we can have a fairer game experience by the way i love the game i feel inspired by the design and the world it helps me to feel good when i am in a bad mood i love so much the characters i feel connect with them and with their stories the gameplay is very fun
5,best mobile game i have ever played i cannot believe it is free it does have breath of the wild vibes but it is definitely a game of its own it has an in depth story gameplay and visuals i have enjoyed playing it so much i downloaded it for my computer and i plan on getting the nintendo switch version one released the continuous support and update of the game is great as well if you always wanted the console experience on your phone definitely download this game and give it a try
5,i truly love this game with the wishing system being really interesting and with the quests being really fun to do the best part of this game is with all sorts of puzzles but can sometimes be frustrating with being able to climb glide and go all sorts of stuff with gajets and able to play with other players is really fun you do not have to play turn based but you do need to be able to know how to level up your characters and help them be stronger we all start somewhere in this game
2,well i was gonna give this a game a good review it had good graphics i love the open world good music too but now everytime i launch the app and begin the game now it freezes on the loading screen and waiting is not helping and re downloading it does not fix the problem i have tried the other options that usually help but no so i guess it was nice while it lasted which was not even a whole day really a disappointment so thanks for wasting six hours of my life
5,this is by far one of the best games i have ever played in my life its soo realistic the quest are sometimes challenging which makes it even more fun to play it is soo cooolll
2,it is a gorgeous game with amazing graphics engaging characters and a beautiful storyline but there is a glitching sound during the cutscenes and whenever a character speaks that makes the game unplayable and unpleasant not sure what causes the issue but it ruins the game for me i hope there is a support team i can contact i am not sure if the issue is my phone or the game
1,the download takes way too long i couldnt even play the game since my phone died first before the download wad done
2,the game restarted to the beginning pls fix it
5,the game has been a joy so far i have not encountered any bugs or issues with the gatcha system having registered before release was able to obtain a nice array of characters graphics are beautiful combat is excellent the storyline developing nicely if somewhat aimed at a younger marker as always it will be end game where issues with grind or pay to win start emerging it is too early to predict how this will go noone should be adverse to paying for a good game though
4,i have been playing since four ver my summary combats two artifacts one gacha four exploration five graphic sfx five story five if you want a skill based combats this game is not for you with the worst unimproved artifacts rng it will be impossible to deal ideal damage moreover the combats are bland clunky and too slow for me the enemies patterns are not exciting to play too then all you do is tap skill change teammate tap skill tap burst yada yada others great
4,great game it would be five star but wish i could play with my backbone controller please add the compatibility how come iphone is supported but not android i have had to stop playing since i got my backbone using the screen sucks
4,amazing its so fun to play and to level up butmi have a hard time when i am in the snowy mountain highly dangerous in the game it is really nice to play but it glitches alot i am on a chromebook ios but the game would glitch and kick me out sometimes and on my chrome i cannot hear the persons voices i do not understand the meaning of the game and story but it is fun only problem it takes up a bunch of storage but otherwise it is a win win situationten over tenhighly recommend for anime lovers
5,casual relaxing eh hem abyss game that is phenomenal on pc but convenient on mobile game music is amazing character designs diverse with breathtaking scenery there is no endgame content so take your time enjoying the game
4,almost perfect in my opinion only setbacks being the lack of control customization controller support and most importantly how it heats up my device by a lot its a galaxy s ten so not too low in the settings department to the point where i fear for the longevity of my phone if i keep playing even though i am doing so in the lowest settings possible for the game other than that yes it checks all the boxes of an awesome game
3,i give star for some reason good storyline good story environment time grinding needed for the artifacts n lvlup four its a gacha game need good pull spend money five map too huge to explore six a lot of quest to do seven chara background interesting eight lot of storage used nine story quest since update i cannot download the update and wondered am i the only who cannot play after this update as everyone can see theres a lot of than in my review please check
3,i am enjoying this game so much but i do have one huge complaint why is there no cotroller support for mobile a fast paced game such as this need something better than on screen touch controls even the touch controls are not very customizable as i would like to be able to change the locations of the joystick and buttons you have controller support for pc and it works great so i would not think it is out of the question to ask for it otherwise great game
4,the fontsine update pulled me back from almost quitting the game its amazing it is awesome to explore underwater this is the start i know but would be awesome if we can attack underwater with some other methods if not with the character skills anyways great work but i couldnt believe when i saw the update it was of gb in pc same as that of the game size itself i mean really
3,fantastic and beautiful however keeps crashing i do not know what to do i have cleared the cache and data i have looked online to find a fix and i cannot make it right i load the game and anywhere between twenty seconds and a few minutes the game crashes every single time was not like this before the update and now it is so frustrating i want to delete the game minus the crashing it is a really fun and relaxing game to play
2,the story lines are interesting characters design are fantastic therere many places to explore the events are okay the sceneries are absolutely breathtaking overall the game is fine i would definitely recommend others to play it the problems i have with this game is that it took way too many storage space not only that it is rly laggy and the screen would sometimes freeze it is rly annoying pls fix it
4,good graphics but no as much as expected of that size eight gb
5,truthfully i did not know what to expect when i first downloaded this i was doubtful due to the large storage after version update the audio would sometimes lag but other than that i love the characters especially zhongli the graphics are decent but the effort put into the graphic design is most definitely astonishing other than storage and audio quality issue this game is amazing
5,i luv this game so much and not just the graphics are good the characters are made by perfect details and beautiful names
1,used to be fun not anymore more interesting games are out there and they still manage to keep thier players entertained but just not this one
5,i have been playing for a year and really enjoy it they are constantly fixing issues and making the game more streamline along with adding new events characters and items it is different to play a game thats story is still in the works and being added with each new version but i do not mind the gradual reveal on top of the game being free they are always giving out stuff there is also absolutely no pay to win aspect
5,great graphics the music department is absolutely amazing the mechanics are easy to understand the characters have different personalities the stories are good despite this it has its flaws after you have finished the story there is almost nothing to do especially when there is resin that further limits your activities and takes long time to refill only one end game content nothing to keep you hooked after you finished main story and the devs does not seem to listen to its community
5,play the game on my laptop and enjoy it there but this game takes up around a of my phone space and i cannot put it on my phones other larger memory card so unless you have a really large storage as part of the base phone it is not really playable on phone but again i really enjoy the game and hope it continues i want to see the end of the story hopefully some characters get buffed so all characters are fully viable throughout this game also please add backbone controller support
4,the graphics gameplay and controls are outstanding i rated this four stars becauase of this bug the game constantly closes from time to time their are not issues with my device storage space aswell as my ram but i still cleared alot of space to see if that is the cause of the problem but sadly no even though i have cleared a large amount of space even cleared cache it still closes from time to time which can be very annonying i hope you fix the bug and if you do i will be sure to change my rate
5,this game is beautiful the world is huge and always has new things to find the puzzles arnt too difficult but do require you to pay attention to complete the sounds are fitting and the music is quite lovely the characters look awesome and the combat is fun there is no auto fighting which i love there are a few glitches though the only one i saw was that sometimes items glitch through the map before you pick them up also it says you can play with friends but does not tell you how
5,very great there is some lag here and there but that aside everything is great the storyline the character building the lore the music the character design etc etc i love this game been my comfort game since twenty twenty two update i love co op with randoms but since i am in asia server lots of them cannot talk in english so communication is quite hard i hope there is something that could be done with this examples auto translate edit after four point two randomly the game would crash
5,i really enjoy the gameplay the storyline is amazing everything about genshin impact is amazing i like how big the map is for a open world type of game the graphics are spot on and for it all being a mobile game is pretty astounding keep making games like this
3,i have been playing for years now i wanna speak up my only issue the only issue i have is that there is not any way to fix it it just sucks that you cannot change the gender of the traveller once you picked it i chose lumine yet it felt rather off when the male traveller is considered the main character of the game it is immersion breaking and a simple change can fix that and would also be good for those who wanna pick the right gender they wish to see in the story cutscenes
1,using chrome os it was fine and run smooth before but suddenly it lags so bad and black box on scene such as trees are so annoying idk what happened it did not even got an update
5,the graphics are beautiful tho you need a good device for it to be very clear or it is gonna be kinda blurry i like the music the places to explore and characters are definitely my favorite things about this game it is okay if you do not spend any money on it too it is just that you need to grind some more to get the characters you want comparing to the ones who do spend as someone who just deletes games quickly due to being picky i have been playing this for about a year now
5,genshin impact is my favorite game but i am a mobile player so genshin updates are my biggest enemy it took eight hours to complete the genshin impact download but i really love this game i love nahida yanfei and other characters design genshin impact is a very good game but not very good for my storage good job hoyoverse
5,i love this game but this game still has a lot more room for improvement especially in co op there are still many regions left and there are still maps that are too clean for exploring and no this is not your typical mmo rpg it is more of a world of immersion atmosphere and world building instead of your typical auto move auto battle system hate those features takes out the immersion of a game appreciate every nook and cranny of the map it is definitely worth it thanks
5,the game is amazing the graphic are amazing for this being a phone game the controls and gameplay are very smooth my one problem is when the characters talk there is a little buzz to it like the sound is too loud for my speakers i have even turned down my volume and put on ear buds but its the same result overall the game amazing
5,this game is cool a lil bit of bugs but meh no worries i still like this game my friend invited me to play this game tho amazing
5,very good game and graphics animation is high level in this game detailing is very good phone like pc
4,the game is great the world is huge and there is many different character modifications and team modifications that you can do you will never get bored of this game and they are still always rolling out special features and new characters the only negative point i have for this game is the fact that there is no voice chat when playing in co op mode and typing while playing is really uncomfortable and difficult the next update also needs to have vehicles
5,this is a great game and i have been playing for roughly two years the graphics the characters the story line and events are all exceptionally well done however the only problem is that it consumes a lot of mobile storage which pretty much makes it difficult for many people with comparatively less storage to download therefore i hope hoyoverse will try to do something about the storage issue all in all its a great game
5,genshin impact is an amazing game i would really recommend it it is helped me make videos and that what help me if you want to see my videos go to crystalshade or isabell and furina is literally my fav character
5,this is an absolutely brilliant game it will take a few months to clear out the current content and the game is set to recieve updates for the next few years the only problem was that the anniversary rewards werent great this was a serious put off for a lot of players but this does not directly affect the game play experience whatsoever especially for a new player overall the beautiful open world interesting storyline unique characters and amazing music make this a must try game for sure
3,i have the lg velvet and for some reason the ground is black and patchy everything else is fine i love the game it makes time pass by beautifully especially with the ambient music in the background the fight mechanics are simple so are the flight controls ill be honest i did have to look up some guides and stuff because the game doesnt exactly give you a step by step guide but its entertaining enough to keep playing even with half assed graphics for some reason please help me out devs
5,very good game good quality graphics music and story to the point that it touches my heart really like the regions so far and look forward to more content of course there can be some improvements made such as the occasional grammar errors and random glitches but considering that this is such a huge game it is hard to patch all the bugs
4,the only complaint i have for the graphics is that i have a crazy powerful phone that tanks this game like it is nothing i would like to see the graphics option allow for distant object to still render as it would on pc or playstation something like a fourfortyp upscale would be cool but i am not sure but i believe that is a thing already controller support needs to be a thing too all in all its a beautiful world and the story is so far well crafted great work keep at it
5,it is actually fun very beautiful great stories and most of all ofc is the characters they are perfect the design is perfect the voices are perfect and most of all the personality are perfect
1,pay to win game the wish system is really bad and every new character powercreeps the other disgusting
5,really an incredible game with a dynamic start and a lot of content in the beginning it lack a bit as the player increase in level but the frequency of events and the very deep lore kinda make up for that plus there is still all the exploration part character building abyss and so on the gacha part is neither good nor bad and of course the game is beautiful and quite fun to play on pc at least
2,with the hype dying down i see that the developers still choose to ignore the sentiments of the players about the game some of which that comes to mind are limited resin for the growing number of domains limited end game content spiral abyss and stupidly biased rng in artifact farming it even gets infuriating when we consider that their other game wherein these similar features are properly recognized and addressed by the developers despite of its status as a newly launched game
5,great experience as a mobile game it is been a while since a mobile game has this much effort put into it it is a really fun open world gacha game with awesome graphics the gameplay is quite average as the controls in mobile are not as simple as the one in pc some transitions when going from one screen to another seems to be a bit buggy such as entering the wish area from the wish button sometimes keeps your adventure hud overall great game great potential needs more improvements
4,great game with no end content and a very expensive wishing system take your time through the story as it gets boring and repetitive once you finish the main quest line
5,the game and gameplay is really cool the game is really responsive and lag free the only problem i found is that some open world noises are not properly mastered and they give out and awful sound other than that good job edit i tried out the game on pc and it works flawlessly the only minor thing i noticed and would be happy to see is to allow key binding changes on the pc version some of the controls are not user friendly also the phone i use to play is samsung galaxy s ten
4,i am finding the game a lot of fun to play it is a lot like the games that are played on the playstation or the xbox i love the cut scenes the plot and the animation they all are amazing and make the game so much better the only issue i have is that i do not think something like this game should be on phones mainly because my phone at least cannot handle it i am not getting that high frame rates so if you decide to play the game get it on a pc or playstation five
3,it is a great game but every time i see water it is weird and it shoots blues at me sumuru do not know if i spelt that properly is the wort my screen is covered in blue most of the time and i had to follow my sister through sumuru only using the map
5,this is game is amazing i really love the quality i play it on my note ten phone the only downside is that the controls are difficult to use when trying to aim and shoot an arrow i just wish it would auto align because for a phone its just too small to control it well if you know what i mean overall its a great game it makes you think and solves puzzles i like that the puzzles are not that hard and that they reward you with a special scene if you get it right it flows with a story
1,takes up a lot of space but love the story and gameplay
5,i love everything about this game but i hope genshin could make a voice chat option so we can communicate during co op mode other than that i give this game ten over ten
3,the download size is too big could you please make it smaller i am on mobile and i only have gigs worth of storage and it is like two hundred nine or something like that
4,feels like a console rpg so far it is a lot of fun
5,the game is great five stars for overall performance characters landscape quests mobs music weapons and overall playability the only problem with this game is that it takes a very fast and strong internet connection to play and takes a very long time to download initially everything is amazing and wonderful as long as you have good internet
2,many things about this game are great examples are the graphics gameplay and most of the lore the biggest issue is that with the representation of characters within certain regions dosent feel like they were designed the way they were supposed to for those who get it get it another very large issue is that if you are an active player past the level of ar fifty and beyond theres not much content left for you to do if you are someone that likes to complete what they can even with events
4,i have just started playing the game and i think it is really good i just have one request i wish that you guys could add a setting to change the graphics like the blurring and all can be changed to a preference since it kinda lags and glitches out my screen edit i noticed you can only change the graphics at a certain point i watched on yt please change that i have to slug with all the lag to get to that point
3,i love this game i am playing it since twenty twenty one and i like the plots and story in general the game is good but is that too difficult to make android user happy why cannot we play with controller too we already have to suffer for the bad grafics
4,this game is so good the graphics the storyline and everything but there is one problem that always bothers me everytime that i will face dvalinstormterror the visual bugs on the screen will show i thought it can be fixed by redownloading the game but when i tried it the visual bug still remains that is why i cannot finish the quest about confronting dvalin please help me devs to fix these visual bug
5,i cannot describe how much i been loving this game it is great and exciting but the bad thing is that mobile users are now taking too much storage for us especially if you have a low end device and i hope i will be able touch grass again soon cause this game takes alot of time finishing the quest and story that is why people hating it the game and also the people playing judging it in my opinion
5,after a month plus of playing all i could say about this game is that it is amazing astonishingly gorgeous the play style is smooth and unique the characters are different and have their own stories and quests the background music was just heavenly truly a breathtaking experience when you explore throughout this vast wonders not to mention the graphics the design and art style of the game not much of a pay to win in a case most rpg games do definitely deserves a five star
4,this is a great game in everything but it has a problem when i launch the game it sometimes does not launch or launch super lagy
5,genshin is a great game if you take the time to be smart with your resources and plan correctly a lot of people complaining probably are not doing that and are spreading their resources thin between every character they have i stuck with my core four characters from ar forty and i have not had any issues with gameplay difficulty graphics are great i love that it is a cross platform game that i can play on my pc or phone when i am on the go i am looking forward to future content updates
5,it is sow many story and you now it is more adventure i love this game i really like this game sow genshin deserve give her five star
5,im inlove with this game this is so perfect best rpg games yet i have ever play even though after a few updates seems like me or other free to play player have a low rate of pulling five star characters i want to give a four six stars rate but here is a five stars rate good job team developers keep it up for next update
5,this is amazing i rate it ten over five stars if i could it is exactly what i was looking for in a game but i would like to create my own character
5,good game with lots of stories and various characters
5,the game has blown my expectations clear out of the sky absolutely amazing details from the graphics art and music fun gameplay closest thing to a complaint i have is that the controls are almost too sensitive i plan on getting a controller to see if that helps and the fact that i can play on the pc sounds awesome for when i am home and do not want to waste my phones battery data
5,great game overall the gameplay is great for a mobile game and the graphics are amazing the controls on mobile are pretty rough and there is no controller support for mobile the big issue is that mihoyo does not listen to people most of the time bug fixes are nerfs for characters that are meant to be low tier and they have not given quality of life improvements in about six months many of the events are attempts to drive fanart creation i love this game but do not recommend it
5,in this game the graphics are insane and the cool bosses are incredible the characters animations and their fighting style are too good but there is one problem first the game storage is too big play in the phone and second point is that after downloading new updates the game storage became bigger and bigger by the way the i will suggest to this game i give it a five stars
5,i literally cannot login to my old acc in asia server it always say connection timed out login in again i just want to play in my old acc please if anyone knows how to fix it please tell
1,the puzzles are horrible i do not understand how anyone finds them out by themself of has fun doing it they are awful every time i try it i get frustrated and start crying so i have to look it up every time and i am supposedly smart so
4,well this have to be the best game i have been playing it for years now my only issue is the storage my sixty fourgb phone cannot handle all of this if i want to download everything that means that my phone would have less than five gb for my other apps i barely could download my necessary stuff now this game means alot to me i fr want to play it until the endgame if there is any storage optimisations i could do or the game would fix it would be really good other than that everything is good
5,it is very fun and i really love the graphics and the details of each every characters but it frustrates me that the resin is so low and takes a long time to restore which is having to wait for a whole day or just spend primogems for resin and the storage of the game is increasing which some players cannot continue playing this game but overall i really enjoy it and keep up the good work
5,it is a very fun game it does take a whole lot of time to download the data in the beginning but it allows you to leave the app it sends a notification when its done the story is very interesting and you actually have many missions and challenges to do they also tell you how to defeat knew enemies that you have not been with i love this game totally recommend it
5,crazy how much stuff they fit into this game and still got it to run on mobile
4,the best open world action game that i have experienced only drawback is that it takes a lot of storage and it is especially worrisome for mobile players i hope they make a cloud or something to store our progress elsewhere
4,the game is good but i hoped that it has more endgame content rather than abyss commissions and resin burn it is gotten so boring now but what really made me come back into it are the characters especially the drip marketing looking forward for fontaine
5,i have been looking for an open world title like this since ages the overall experience is amazing the ui does not seem clustered like some other games out there the app does not confuse you too much with the active quests you have the enemies are adaptive and you can easily counter them with proper strategy deserves a five star rating without a doubt
5,i have played this game since december twenty twenty two and i can say its the best thing that has ever happened to me the community is great and i have met wonderful people on genshin
4,this game is incredibly beautiful it is easily an addicting game with storytelling quests foraging cooking leveling up of characters and weapons in my opinion this game is like an anime adaption of breathe of the wild and skyrim rolled into one my only issue is the controller circle it is awkward with my small hands to smoothly control the direction of my character an option to customize where the controls are located would be much better so that i can move and fight better please
3,i love genshin impact but i play on the playstation compared to that the mobile version is abysmal the controls especially are terrible i would be nice if i could sync my playstation controller with it also i put the graphics on the lowest settings and my phone still overheats after a few hours despite all that i appreciate the cross play so i can keep up with dailies and events while i am not home
5,ok i have decided to continue installing the game as there just are not many good games for android running on an exynos seight the game has stuttering and freezing issues during cinematics and sometimes when attacking the game takes the graphics of zelda breath of the wild and the character story of world of final fantasy and the fighting aesthetic of nier automata it is a fantastic game overall great game to use with a controller i do not recommend it with just a touch screen
5,i started playing in late october twenty twenty i immediately fell in love with this game as soon as i started playing everything is amazing the graphics the design the map everything the gameplay is lovely though it sometimes lags while the cut scenes are playing it might just be my phone though but something ive noticed is that i cannot pick up things as fast not sure i it is just me but this has definitely been a wonderful experience looking forward to future updates mihoyo
5,super duper fun and intriguing to another level the graphics are top quality and absolutely stunning the soundtrack is so pretty and it fits the game very well the actual game play and storyline is really unique and interesting i also love that we have side quest options and its super easy to level up i would totally reccomend this game to anyone who likes adventures rpg combat and relaxing music this game gets a one hundred out of five from me all the way
4,fantastic game beautiful graphics and amazing gameplay this is by far one of the longest and best games i have ever played however there are still some issues such as the infamous resin problem the artifact system is also quite bad imagine grinding in a domain for hours and all you get is just a defence or hp type of artifact it is just disappointing but other than that everything is good
5,an overall amazing experience i love the mechanics of the game such as the combat cooking and gliding it is similar to botw and i love the aspects similar to it like the climbing amazing graphics amazing storyline the controls are great everythings nice and organized definitely my favorite free to play game of all time
4,i have played the game on my playstation before and it was amazing good graphics storyline the lot the only problems i have had is that you cannot choose your region kn the playstation meaning i cannot play with any of my friends i am also unable to download it on phone it continues pending without installing it is the only app that has this issue
5,this game as far as reasonable complaints go i cannot think of one despite not having controller support the controls are still excellent the graphics compromise little between playstation and mobile and the exploration is at the core of the experience initially i was expecting this to be a bargain bin botw but in truth i enjoy it more a free game with micro transactions keep it up
1,i am a one point zero player who loves this game i have spent fort hundred dollar on welkin and battle pass however consecutive losses on the mistsplitter and song of broken pines banners last year along with ongoing defeats in their reruns have changed my feelings the flawed weapon banner system frustrates me this year i lost five times in a row trying to get my desired weapon i can only pull one five star weapon each banner but five consecutive losses are too much i am fed up and considering uninstalling this
5,this game may have sucked away my soul and killed my dog but it is absolutely massive for a one hundred percent free game with five or six over seven if you are a time traveler fully explorable nations unique elemental interactions an actually good gacha system and still runs amazingly on mobile
5,i never thought i would see a game like this i mainly play it on pc but just having the ability to transfer my save to my phone and play it anywhere feels amazing my phone runs a little slow and loading times take a while but it works the game feels like what breath of the wild would be as a gatcha game but also stands entirely on its own being able to have a vast open world like that on my phone is just mindblowing
5,an amazing game with months of content and an enticing storyline characters with deep backstories the only problem is there is not much in the way of appreciation for players and the events are repetitive and tedious
3,i think the game is overall solid and needs more polishing the game has very good soundtracks and a decent story that could engage me i think the gameplay is pretty fun and the open world is really beautiful the issue that it has is the dialougue in story tends to repeat the thing that has been said before and the whole artifact system which is mostly rng based is pretty bad imo but overall i think the whole game can fix these things and even then it is a good game even with these issues
5,this has been the game i have been constantly coming back everyday since the day it was released it has been a great escapism during all the craziness and quarantining at home due to the pandemic beautiful graphics fun characters and a stunning soundtrack i listen to even outside playing the game itself of course i have my complaints as well concerning the franchise listening more to the playerbase and their concerns but if they take note of issues i think it will continue to flourish
5,the game is good but the update was hava a lot of ads puffing and my app keep loading from the start and still puffing the ads that will make me irratateable
3,genshin impact has captivated millions of players with its immersive world and engaging gameplay however like any complex game it is not without its flaws one particular area that requires improvement is the occurrence of bugs when defeating childe i have experienced various bugs one of the prominent issues is related to childes transformation mechanics occasionally when transitioning between different phases childe may get stuck in an animation loop or fail to transition altogether
1,the game is undeniably abysmal especially when it comes to the abysmal chances of obtaining a five star item personally i find myself much more enthralled by the captivating graphics and resource acquisition system of honkai impact rd unlike genshin impact it excellently promotes resource management and grinding providing a far more immersive and satisfying gameplay experience
5,pros excellent graphicswhen compared to other mobile games smooth gameplayconsidering the graphics a lot of area to explorefor new players and lot of things to keep you engaged cons it is a huge game approx gb even if you play for like hr day you will run out of quests and things to do in a short period of time very very bad resin system it stops you from progressing in the game
5,as a free to play all the way i understand the pain of playing this and aspiring to have insanely good characters but then it is totally enjoyable the visuals music even the lore it is just that we need events more often because once you get to the top rank it just becomes boring no more quests to complete
3,i have been playing for a while and its quite fun the only reason im giving it a star is because the wish system is quite tedious as you can do so many wishes and only get one five star like me and if you are at a decently low level it is difficult to get primogems
5,this is the best anime fighting game i have ever played i love all the detail and all the characters things i wish that would be added are more dark skin characters to be more inclusive and mounts because of the time limit for sprinting
4,absoloutly love the game its tons of fun and has a great story only issue with it for me atleast is it takes up wayyy too much storage for the mobile version so ill probably have to install it on my pc if i wanna keep playing
5,super an amazing game story is just very good animation is on next level the availability to play in mobile is just too asesome
4,everything about the game is great from the graphics to the performance absolutely stunning and smooth for the first day or two after release even after i get rid of all my background tasks and using game launcher and on lowest settings my s twenty plus still gets uncomfortably hot this should not be happening on a top of the line phone please optimise the game the temperature is causing the rest of the game to throttle leading to frame stutter and lag as well
5,so far overall lvl ten there is a lot of content for a free game the story is compelling simple and slowly builds at a pace where i can remember it you can explore literally everywhere and there are always things to find the fighting is fun and looks great bosses are actually very hard and can take multiple tries depending on your team and gear very straightforward to upgrade your team and gear the art style is awesome and do not worry paimon gets more tolerable later on
3,it took about hours until i could play the game most of it being the downloading files stuff but the other was issues with the opening cutscene the sound was glitchy and the screen was all white i had no trouble choosing one of the twins but after that i had the same problem for the rest of the cutscene i got out of the game and went back in and the second one was fine the gameplay is pretty good and i love the graphics
5,best mobile game ever existed days active eight hundred ninety one days never got bored still playing and will be day check one thousand fourty six days date eight nov twenty three days count one thousand one hundred and eighteen
3,the game is great however after the latest update i cannot get in to play i get to the screen where it says tap to start but then the loading screen after just crashes or freezes i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling verifying my files contacting customer support and even deleting my older apps but noting it works just fine on my pc however i hope that this issue is fixed soon
2,it is very fun once you start out but as you keep progressing there is gradually less and less to do as a late game player there are very limited ways to get primogems other than buying them in addition to this since there are very little new quests there are about thirty minutes of content every day the resin system is also very discouraging since you can only do a limited number of domains and do not get me started on the drops the game could be easily improved
4,i love this game it is so beautiful and the chars are hot the quests are kinda long tho
5,quite possibly the best game i have played on my phone i cant get enough graphic are spectacular gameplay while a little confusing to start is easy to adapt to the controls could be a little better and a button to climb instead of auto climbing and randomly climbing trees in combat would be nice also an option to auto pick up would be nice too gets a little tedious would also like to be able to switch server as the recommended has high latency great game highly reccomended
4,game going good so far and as a free to play player the rd anniversary rewards are very good i just wish that the octobaby has more animations
3,i have this downloaded on my laptop and it has smooth graphics and the game is good the thing only thing is some maps triggered one of my phobiasthalassophobia it also made me have anxiety alot of times it would be better if the events were easier because sometimes it is very stressing overall the game is good but i just hope it will not happen again
3,definitely one of the games i played for a long time however the more you play the game the more you realize how the games content is actually not that many some might argue that this is false because there is so many nations locations before i would have agreed but after playing this game for more than a year i disagree my reasoning for it is because exploring teyvat is not that hard teyvat is very easy to explore the map is also really easy to understand which makes exploring really easy other than that the characters are all designed well reward system is very flawed in my opinion it takes a long time to actually get primogems game currency once you are an end game player which would sometimes brainwash you into pretty much acting as if the daily commission is a chore story lore wise however is really good i love the lore and it is very engaging events in game is sometimes it is extremely uninteresting and sometimes it is really engaging so it just depends on your personal tastes
5,it is a great app i love it but i am having a hard time opening the game i have storage but it will not open i am struggling
3,amazing game however the controls the lack of control support and inability to customize the combat buttons are very frustrating the buttons are too close together and i often find myself pressing the wrong buttons in bad situations the game itself is amazing work but proper controller dualshock xbox etc support also instead of the directional buttons functioning like a traditional d pad it should work like an analog stick with slide to move rather than press it makes it easier to move
4,it is definitely an amazing experience especially with the details of lore and the different settings however i think that the co op experience can definitely be enhanced and unfortunately the game is not suitable for all devices like mobile because the game takes up too much storage otherwise it is a really cool game
4,the game is good the art the world and voice over everythings great just needs a lot of optimization on android the on screen controls could have been customisable playing at sixtyfps on sd eightfifty five drains the battery in just a few minutes and heats up the phone like crazy just fix that and this will be great game to play on mobile
5,actually at first i am so confused at this game but after that it is starting to get beautiful story character flashback quest primogems character and even exploration killing some monster boss and etc even the places i am into this
2,very poorly optimized my phone immediately heats up just from loading it it does not do this with other heavy apps i can barely stay on it for less than five minutes until i get a black screen and am kicked out from the game loading times incredibly long i have spent more time on loading screens than actually playing it it is a shame because it looks really good regarding world building art and character design may try installing it again at a later date maybe it works then
5,nice game but it takes a lot of gb ram like twenty seven gb when you download the resources of this game
2,it is a very fun and enjoyable game at first After maybe a week of playing you completely run out of things to do in the world and the only real repeatable content is locked behind the resin system which is basically just stamina from other mobile games You only get one hundred twenty max resin and everything costs between twenty to sixty resin per run The game quickly turns into one where you log on spend your resin in zero five minutes then log out Genshin has a lot of potential and I just hope it is fixed
5,beautiful experience so far ui could use some tweaking though to make it better for me anyways i have a sony experia ii which uses the nine aspect ratio and the controls are not ideal for this setup as my fingers cover more screen than necessary pulling the controls out closer to the edges would greatly improve the experience if possible
4,this game is amazing but there are some issues i have with the game when i play the lag is so ridiculously bad that i can barely move around without it freezing up on me also the animated scenes such as the dragon scene does not render in well it just shows blue everywhere i would love to see you fix this and i would love to play this more the pc version is my personal favorite but it would be fun to play mobile
5,one of the best game in play store story line and graphics is excellent but the game download size is around six gb not recommended for low end devices
5,spoiler alert i must say it is a very good game but now i am having difficulties i do not mind the lag but when using the bow i cannot move the sight meaning i must get out of the aiming stance and change my line of view and for the dragon it somewhat glitched out and blocked my view it probably because of my current device since i do not see anyone else is having this issues still a good game with a wide area to explore i just hope this get fixed since i am now stuck at the dragon fight p
5,it is really an awesome game i have been playing for years also one of my favourite story games
5,an amazing game that i spend way too much time on it is not too hard for casuals but it also gives a good challenge for hardcore gamers it does not rely in an afk aspect and gives the player control of the gameplay which in my experience is a lot more fun it is a grind type of game though music has the emotional and distinct feel between regions you explore designs are detail oriented masterpieces and the open world gives the story the overall grandeur of a good time
1,good story great graphics and beatiful artsyle is what i would say if they actually cared for theur mobile fanbase if you own anything less than an iphone then you have to endure through countless hours of lag and low quality polys not to mention the game is getting pw something that would maybe put my review to four stars is to add a skip button its not that hard
5,the best game i ever played with a good graphics and a interesting story line this game is amazing
4,this game is phenomenal graphics are incredible gameplay is nicely packed and the story is intriguing however this is just me but i would like more abilities not like more classes like air and water but more ways to use them each character does have their own set of abilities but adding more would make this game so much for strategy intense and fun some powers can be weaker than others at some points and some may just give a small boost
5,this is by far the best open world game i have ever played the heroes are very likeable and battle mechanics are quite understandable the storyline is very admirable and the voiceover of the hero is beautiful even the graphics is pretty i played many games like this but so far it is graphics is among the most beautiful i only have one problem the lag is unbearable i have to exit the game and reconnect again because it causes lag after some dialogue but anyway five stars for you devs
2,a very fun and pretty good game but it takes up way too much space on my phone the app itself takes up twenty gb there is also other on my phone which takes up a whole lot of space which i am just gonna blame this game for that because i cannot think of anything else it would be after the most recent update which added sumeru the game has been crashing so much i have set the graphics lower which allowed me to play for maybe thirty minutes but then it started crashing almost every ten minutes again
5,i like this game played it for more than two years played it since release till now i like the way that this game does not require ypu to play at long periods of time where you only have to do commissions dailies and events then logout you only need to login about ten minutes each day the story is good the gameplay and art is good and i really like the characters though the only down side is that it takes a long time to get characters you want it takes a lot of time to get enough pulls
5,so far one of the most graphically impressive and fun to play game for mobile i have seen and or played love the on screen controls and the ability to actually control your characters movements and attacks sure five gb download is asking a lot from mobile devices storage capabilities but it is well worth it for what you get
5,the characters are great and their abilities are useful i like the fact that you can venture around by foot teleportation or by flying and see other areas i found it easier to buy items and potions to help upgrade my weapons and characters without having to use real money to do so the game quality is great and i have had no trouble hearing the voice characters i also like the fact that i can test against some harder level enemys without being restricted
2,can barely condense my resin game is constantly freezing crashing etc even on lowest graphic settings now i do not have the newest phone but it is up to date and has no problems with other games i just wish there was an app where i could preview my account and condense resin so i can use later when i have time on pc instead of having to log into this app to do anything for it to inevitably crash within a minute
5,ive been playing this for like a year now and this is actually the best game i have ever play the updates and event are so cool this was the first game i actually have experienced comfort every time i feel down this game is actually the one making me feel happy not only is this game fun but it is also comforting never would have thought i would be so obsessed with a game keep up the good work i am hoping for more improvement in the future
1,when i fight with abyss herald we will be reunited quest it got sudden lag restarted i tried several times to play the archon quest then also this problem
5,this game is very good whit good story and good characters i love anime and this is good game i recommond to download
5,this game is fun but it has made me feel such pain i had to schedule an appointment with my counselor if you do not wish to spend money on a game or feel pain i do not recommend but other than the gambling addiction i have gotten from this and the mental strain it gave me after losing a to my least favorite character just to give me a fale hope on the permanent banner to yet again give me my second least favorite character than its a pretty good game i would say
5,it is the best game ever the animation and the quality is way out of my league it so good that i want to play this game forever
5,this game has been my addiction over the past few months it is amazing the graphics the lore chefs kiss i have had loads of fun and it became a virtual hang out for me and my friends one things missing tho android controller support pls pls i beg you please give us android users controller support as fun as this game is some of us struggle with touch control so pls have mercy pls pls pls pls please
4,i am not too far in so i guess it might still be ruined but this is the best game on the app store after minecraft hands down the combat feels incredibly fluid and works pretty damn well on a touchscreen the graphics are really pretty and definitely pushing what phones can display the movement albeit a little flawed feels more than good enough and the open world works well the music is great but the implementation needs work the open world is a bit closed off which i do not love
5,this is the best mobile game that i ever played but high specs phone needed to play this game smoothly overall this game is awesome and very different with other game no ranking system so you do not need to spend much money because you have no one to compete with just enjoy the game rpg players absolutely love this game because the stories are fascinating and the nature scenes are awesome with good bgm i have been playing for almost years and never get bored on this game
3,i have been playing this game for almost year and the game is really fun it has great graphics nice gameplay great story plot and the character designs are wonderful but the rewards are lacking for challenges and events that needed so much effort very little rewards are given which is why i gave it stars i just hope this changes in the future
4,it is an amazing game the visuals are beautiful the music is so emmersive the storyline is awesome everything about it is perfect except for the fact that it does not work well on mobile devices i mostly play on my phone and most everything works fine but when it comes to a cut scene it keeps freezing and it will not work on my laptop other than that everything is amazing and it is and awesome game would totally recomend if you do not mind the cut scene thing on mobile have the right laptop
5,edit five issue below resolved hope this upcoming update it will not happen again edit seven i am now encountering server network issues i do not have a lot of devices connected to my wifi and i have never encountered this error until the last update maintenance cannot log in now and play and claim my everyday ninetyprimos from welkin
4,the games is really well made most scenes are voice acted so you do not have to read paragraphs to understand the lore it looks great and i have not experienced many glitches besides some movement issues after playing a few hours but you cannot expect much from a game with touch screen mechanics overall i give the game a eight eight out of ten consideringits free my oppion may change later
5,seriously awesome i am a sucker for these anime inspired adventure games sadly my pc is trash but it works ok on my phone the only problem i have is the lack of controller support i was suprised to find out that my phone controller didnt connect it seemed like the game that would have it sucks that my fingers are in the way of the beautiful graphics i hope in new updates they will include it
5,i am a huge fan of animes especially fantasy ones i love the style the atmosphere and the open world exploration you feel like you have seen everything but the map is so big that you cannot help but keep running around even when your main objective is sidelined by something else and enemies to fight with best part is that the game is not pay to win i recommend the game to anyone who wants to kill some time by some time i mean hours good job guys
5,this game is absolutely awsome i have been playing it for two months now and i must say i became addicted i love the graphics and the quality and the voice actors but there is something that i would like to be changed leveling up your adventure rank is quite hard and slow that sometimes i lose hope and the artifacts thingy is not quite explained during the game so i had to rely on other resources to understand so i would like an explanation from them plus for the leveling up to become easier
2,the story is very good but it keeps crashing every second and gets disconnected at the most crutial moments the gaming experience is terrrible with this issue
4,i love this game and how everything is so clean and smooth it is definitely worth playing with an asterisk playing on phone is more hindering and is definitely not how to play it the phone screen is too too small to really enjoy the visuals and the controls leave much to be desired for that platform i think i want gonna move to pc and that will be how i play
3,fix dehya good music good combat good environment but bad power balance each character bad ranged weapon system such as bow and catalyst auto aim is in trouble and dev never care about it i played this game since it have launched but right now they do still not fix it i feel like i waste money everything in game is gacha including artifacts i hope one day dev will make random droping better story in game is good forten over tenpatch story patch is so rush and unreasonable
4,the game is fun to play good graphics storylines pretty places to discover and gorgeous characters but overall it is not fair for low end devices to experience such horrid gameplay like for example there is no grass the water is glowing with bloom on the numbersdmg or in battle reactions and last it lags on new places as well it would be a big help if the developers would fix it
5,the game is amazing and the story too but i have this problem on my phone in ventis story quest act confront stormterror when fighting dvalin it is laggy on mobile i hope the devs fix this please i wanna play the game without the lag edit they have updated it and the lag was gone btw it is an amazing game thanks developers for fixing it
3,deleted my old review a good game and all but the storage it is too much for a game and i am sure many players quit because of that it was nice while it lasted but not even my sd card has thirty gb left so i cannot play anymore see ya when i get a new phone genshin
5,it is an sick game with a huge open world beautiful graphics and amazing story line and voice acting even though its a big game it is worth the space be prepared though for a couple game glitches to pop report them to make the game more enjoyable for everyone however there is this one serious bug that has been ruining my experience audio glitch where all sounds go static after a while of just playing the game hope it gets fixed soon so i can enjoy the voice acting and music to the fullest
5,to be honest a game like this should not even require you to use wi fi since it is more like solo game like legend of zelda and co op just gives you the option whether or not you want to play with your friends or other players also the game needs some optimization since it does not really run smoothly even at low graphic settings with mid range phones so it is more likely more compatible and smooth to play with a highspec or gaming phone still i love the game superb for mihoyo
5,very nice but not recommended for less than eight gb storage
5,it is very good you can also play with friends and have even more fun
5,this is a very well done open world rpg graphics are good and the controls were bearable for a mobile game now where is game really shines is on your playstation on a big screen with even better graphics and a controller in you hand for me a much more enjoyable experience the only bad thing i noticed is a low drop rate for five star items all and all i recommend this game
1,if the devs put even a fraction of the passion that the orchestra put into the soundtrack it would be a wonderful game alas terrible drop rates paired with repetitive and dull combat along with an open world that is somehow both packed with missable collectibles and terribly empty at the same time just listen to the soundtrack and you will walk away much happier than if you played it if nothing else avoid playing it so you do not have to spend hours wishing you could strangle paimon
5,i really like this game overall best experience if you play in your computer since this game has amazing graphics it can be hard for your phone to show everything smoothly i think you should play it in a phone with a lot if storage i also like the characters and the system where you can go everywhere to even think a masterpiece like this is free still surprise me i really recommend this game
4,i love this game i have been obsessed for weeks now the characters are super cute and i am completely invested in the story and the current lantern rite event i love how there is always something to do even if you are in between story and archon quests only gave four stars because of the bugs currently cannot even log in after updating my phones software i get stuck on a loading screen update i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and i still cannot log in
3,the game is really nice everything about it is amazing from combat to graphics and the scenery is amazing even in low graphics however i have been seeing a lot of people especially people who are using the phone brand vivo not being able to play for more than thirty minutes or more than two hrs i have been experiencing this hope you guys can fix it soon but over all the game is amazing i love it hopefully i can play it soon
2,good game but npcs talk too much and quests running from npc to the next are way too long
4,this game is if not the best game on the phone it is definitely one of the best games i seen a lot of games getting graphically good recently but none like this it has a lot of breath of the wild mechanics but it is still so different from it that it becomes it is own thing only issue i noticed so far is there is no controller support although the touch controls are still good just wish i could use a controller and if they add that support i would give five stars but for now it is four stars for me
4,it is a really good game story gamplay graphics are all really good the one problem is lag during all the major cutscenes the game lagged horribly the audio cut out and like frames per second i hope this gets fixed but that is really the only problem i have had with the game
5,the best game i have ever played its very soothing to play i have been playing for a long time since it was released and one thing i have to recommend to be added is to be able to change the position of the buttons mobile is indeed limited in controls as compared to pc but the fact they cant be moved makes it a lot more limited so being able to move it around would be game changing
5,love the game overall mostly play the playstation version actively but i play the phone ver just as much one area of concern i have had is artifacts i know it is not much but there should be a locking feature even with the weapons it is very easy to rush into things in this game as it tends to be very sensitive with clicking into things so it is easy to imagine selecting a maxed out item to use as fodder by accident a simple locking feature always does wonders
2,it is a very fun and enjoyable game at first after maybe a week of playing you completely run out of things to do in the world and the only real repeatable content is locked behind the resin system which is basically just stamina from other mobile games you only get one hundred twenty max resin and everything costs between twenty to sixty resin per run the game quickly turns into one where you log on spend your resin in zero five minutes then log out genshin has a lot of potential and i just hope it is fixed
5,for quite few days game is showing me network error forty please look after it i am an asia server player
4,the release of sumeru gave so much to do i have been playing for over a year it is got amazing graphics and tons of different characters to choose from the story has got us anticipating more although it is captivating it is not really new player friendly the new characters and weapons require items that new players cannot have access to it can cause them to rush through the story other than that however the game has been treating us nicely i hope the second year anniversary will not fail us
2,character designs are amazing combat playstyle is great overall this game is aten over tenthe reason i gave it a stars is because it takes too much storage space i have tried reinstalling several times and uninstalling it again but it is no use i deleted almost all of my photos and cleared my cache but it did not let me enter the game i am just stuck at the loading screen where it says insufficient space please fix this issue
5,super great game hi early one of the best on mobile it does take a really super long time to download data and start the game up but that is not the apps fault all in all the game is really great graphics are incredible the music is honestly some of the best the character design is chefs kiss it is such a worth while game if you give it the time
4,been playing for a year now and so far the games really good the terrain and the views are the best part apart from the story but after the archon quests there feels a lack of content to do the only problem is that the phone heats up like crazy and so i can only play for a short time before i have to let it cool down
1,the new area is cool but nothing seems out of ordinary the new archon quest is super boring and there is no actions what so ever talking to npc all the time plus the new archon is annoying pick a fight with the traveler said she want to fight the traveler but instead talking the entire scene
5,it is just perfect the design the graphics the voice actors everything i love the stories and characters in there the only problem is lag whne i first start genshin during the day for the first time it gets a little laggy and it is not because of my wifi usually i would have to quit then rejoin to be able to play without any lag other than that everything is great and i especially love the three point zero update thank you for creating this game mihoyo and great work
3,this game runs terribly on my htc ten there should be a hardware check or some form of benchmark before letting you decide if you want to perform the six gb download or not the intro could barely play freezing most of the time and the game looks blurry otherwise from what i have managed to play it looks promising not a fan of onscreen keypads but the controls are pretty well designed making picking up items and controlling the camera easy hopefully better optimised at some point
5,the game is very well done in terms of many aspects such as playstyle story telling puzzles graphics etc in my opinion however the controls needs a bit tweaking manually tweaking preferably another thing is as i progress later in the game too much resources rely on resin i mean its not bad its just the resin regeneration takes too long thus for me there wont be much chance to resupply myself for the current event nor the next one
5,it is a really great game love it since i downloaded this game i do not have time for any other game n even if i play another game i do not feel as thrilling as i play this game it is challenging and the graphic the story the quests are absolutely well planner however i would give it a five if the promotional characters banner that already passed to be back again in the wish some people started late so they do not get the opportunity to pull for them a lot of people would pay for that
5,please increase the zoom out in the map please it getting too big for the mobile screens
4,the game is good graphics are crisp though personally i wish i had the choice of what weapons my character can use no matter the class be it mage archer heavy swordsman or light swordsman
5,this is such an awesome game i totally recommend it if you enjoy doing puzzles i usually always play this game in my free time to get away from reality although one downside is that sometimes when i am fighting enemies my camera angle always goes low and i cannot end up seeing at all and sometimes i keep climbing random trees or boxes and it is a little annoying but other than that it is an amazing and very well detailed game
4,i downloaded it because of the hype and i have played other mihoyo games before but not for long because i cannot get into the character rotation it just is not my type of battle system so i already failed at the third temple lol when the wind riding and tile jumping stuff becomes the main hurdle to overcome in order to progress without finishing this crucial quest you cannot go on in the game however graphics animation story vas music the many game modes it is all absolutely fabulous
5,awesome game just make sure you have the space for it a very huge game elemental powers different veritys of combat missions and all in a open world map absolutely love this game
4,the gacha rate is terrible edit to be fair music and animations of this game are great however the gacha game companies really need to be transparent about the rate if they want some credibility we really need a law to force the companies to open source their gacha systems edit but the game trailers are insanely good it deserves more stars
5,the graphics are amazing for a mobile game the fighting mechanic is very strategic in terms of using elements to your opponents weaknesses it is a real open world experience four excellent cutscenes with voice and actual mouth movements five super addictive even when you are not doing quests and just exploring the world six co op needs work seven definitely not a pay to win game you can purchase characters with in game currency eight progress saves between all platforms seamlessly
3,i really like this game i love the characters voice acting graphics everything except the storage as of right now it takes up nine gb and it took four gb for this new update four gb to pre install and to actually get the update and for some reason if i switch my game to a different language i cant delete the old one i had honestly the game has beautiful graphics and a wide open world but it really should get some downsize in storage soon i will have to stop playing because of this
3,every single time i decided to fight a weekly boss it goes perfectly fine the grind is great and the rewards are gud except when i am fighting childe for so damn reason every single time i fought him to get the weekly rewards and every single tike it gets to his final form the game decides that its a great idea to leave me on a screen where i can see the boss but i cannot do anything i cannot move cannot attack cannot heal cannot go into the inventory cannot even quit the game please fix
5,this is the only game i have ever been obsessed with i love all the characters their design backstories idiosyncrasies quirks voice overs and more when away from the game to study for my exams i had their soundtrack playing in the background because even the osts are crazy good graphics music design even the advertising for the game is amazing
5,the game is pretty good i started playing since four until now it is been years i am playing this game and so far the story is interesting the graphics is amazing too they got a lot of cool details and i love it
5,i have not found it but if it is not there an ingame monster manual with all the tips we get would be nice also would like a way to locate my friends in coop other than scrolling the whole map searching for their icon besides that great game i am enjoying everything so far the graphics the heroes the challenges and the facr that the whole game does not rely on the energy system
2,the game has great graphics and story but is frustrating to play without a controller which is not currently supported on android for some reason while fighting or exploring the world i would rate this app much higher if it did it plays much much better on playstation with a controller or pc with mouse and keyboard
5,good game been playing since october last year i do not care bout the anniversary rewards it will not make me quit but i will not be spending again for a long while take out the resin system it really puts limitations i would love to grind hard for artifact stats since it has also a really bad rng i do not care about how repetitive the gameplay is every mmorpg i have played feels repetitive anyway i was attracted to genshin cos of the story lore and the art characters are just a plus
5,great exploration and a fun unique combat system the best controls and graphics i have seen on a mobile game also has a huge and detailed world the one real drawback is the gacha system which doesn t give good odds and gets very expensive very fast however ninety nine of the game content can be accessed without it if you easily get addicted to these types of games and feel like you have to collect everything you might want to stay away from this game because you can easily spend a lot of money
3,this game is phenomenal the story and characters are a little lackluster but it does not take away from the intense fun the world is full of stuff todo and explore but there is something that is also part of the playstation port the performance is the worst i am playing on a galaxy eight which should be capable but unfortunately not the playstation as well on my pc tho it runs smoothly and looks awesome i guess they just went overboard on the graphics with this game
1,do not bother with this game there is a massive lack of controler support the servers seem to be a bit unstable random disconnections at peak hours and all around this game just is not it i mean cool i grind i fight i do quests gets a little repetitive as time goes on like the same quests are being repeated but in a different area just do yourself a favor skip this one save that extra hour or two of your life
4,good game good graphics amazing storyline one downside is the storage space it goes from downloading it at four hundred fifty mb to twenty nine gb fix this devs please
5,i love this game so much like it was my favourite game and tbh i do not find any problems in this game it is like the perfect game no ads amaizing graphics outstanding stories and so much more i love this game keep going with the amaizing effort
3,this game is so great i love it and all but i have an issue regarding whenever i play it crashes a lot even though my gameplay is fine and there is nothing wrong with my ping or anything whenever i am in co op with friends it would be hard to play with them since the game keeps crashing in the past i shrugged it off since i believed they would fix the crashing sooner but till now it hasnt
4,game is good please make use of the jump button because it does not do anything add like jump then attacking in mid air to reach the weakpoints of enemy if you are using melee characters add one hundred twenty fps support improve the smoothness of the game on mid range devices because most of the player do not own a high end devices like me improve the loading speed like when you teleport it takes so much time to load in short my concern is the jump button smoothness and the loading speed love this game ️
1,it lets me install it but will not let me play it it keeps saying insufficient memory to download resources
3,the gameplay is nice and the banner released is pretty much good as in not too fast nor slow the gameplay allows good coop however the resins system is bad as it is too slow to generate the resins almost everything depends on the resins another thing is for those who do not have twenty nineteen phone onwards you can kiss goodbye to the game as the ram requirement is high even if you set to the lowest graphic you cannot play the game well
4,an issue i hate is the camera angles when im fighting an enemy i wouldnt want the camera to be at the ground no one wants that the moment i start hitting an enemy it moves automatically and it ruins the experience it shouldnt be moving too much in weird low angles it should prioritize high angles for the fight also recently there have been some issues with the screen freezing it will just freeze not just on my device but for other people i know aswell
5,ilove the game i find it super fun to play even if it takes two hours just to load
4,its been a year i think since i started this game and it is been a week since i last log in to this game i do not know but i am kinda tired burn out and feeling lazy to log in on to this game the game is good as well as the story it is just that it does not give the same excitement as it gives me before it is a must to experience tho
5,this is a really well made game with such good graphics on mobile the animated scenes are amazing in literally everything too the only problem for me is when fighting a lot of hilichurls the sound quality goes way down but that could be fixed with some headphones plugged in or turning the volume a bit low and then it is all good i really recommend this game
3,this is seriously a good game for me i can get distracted easily since there are lots of other things to do than the main quest the characters are loveable and the scenery are spectacular have not gotten any lag spikes and i get to lower the resolution or heighten the resolution to whatever i want controlling the characters and fighting monsters is quite smooth the weapon banner pity system does not transfer and the anniversary sucks a lot sometimes i wonder if mihoyo is really listenin
2,recently i have only been getting a black screen when i load up the game on my phone
4,overall i love this game and its very fun to play with cute characters and an interesting lore however i would like to play this game everyday but it takes up far to much storage and on certain devices even lags to the point you pretty much cannot play the game anymore the last time i was able to play was about weeks ago and when i tried a different device windows computer it just blacks out
4,it is really good game but dam why red signal i mean it spike ninety to sevenninety ping even i am close enough to wifi router no lag but when it reach ninety ninenine ping it reconnect but my character is dead when it get connected maybe i should change server for better ping not the recommended server
4,the game is very fun and it provides lots of content at first when you start there is an overwhelming amount of content but then down the road after around ar forty five it is just all gone plus at around ar forty five is when you have to constantly grind materials and the limiting factor is resin you get very little and it replenishes slowly however the game is still very enjoyable and the abyss is a fun challenge fights are fun and graphics are great overall good game
1,worst app i tried to play it but it said i had no storage left so i dleated a lot of things still would not let me so i dleated more things and still will not let me
5,sooo good interesting characters skills and strategies just enough instruction if you want it while giving the option to figure things out on your own which i love to do adventure rpg i have not enjoyed a game this much in a while plays great on mobile with two hundred gb space onscreen touch controls are done extremely well i would like to see a larger limit on commission quests and a closer gap between level restricted quests and xp gain thank you for all your hard work devs
5,very easy to use the sceneries are gorgeous and fabulous but sometimes the puzzles are a little but complicated other than that it is a wonderful game
5,it is one of the best game on mobile i ever played only downside is a high power consumption and overheating my phone xiaomi mi eightpro so i cannot play longer then hour straight and have to let my phone to cool down i believe that it is not an issue on latest devices with more advanced cooling system over all excellent game with great graphic controls and story
4,been playing for almost years now and i can safely say amazing game and the graphics is absolutely phenomenal one thing though if you like collecting characters but you are not willing to spend money on the game well it is going to be a thorny ride for you otherwise you still can clear most of the games content with lower rarity characters
5,i do end up playing this game ninety nine percent of the time on my windows computer but having the choice to login on one platform or the other alone whenever it is convenient makes it such a wonderful experience this game is clearly inspired on botw when it comes to visuals and climbing mechanics however the fighting mechanics are a lot more fun and much much deeper elemental reactions lots of gear to boost different status changing between four characters on the fly to come up with some crazy tactics amazing and enticing story line with interesting characters the pity system ensures you can always get new characters even if you are just a free to play player you can get away with also only investing around thirty minutes a day in the game if you are a busy person and get all the most crucial stuff done and did i mention you can cross play with windows and playstation players it is just such a pleasant experience to group up with friends and explore the world no matter where they choose to play as long as they are from the same server region at least the fact that your character is stuck to the server you have created it in is my only real major complaint
5,love it the story is super interesting the art and animation are wonderful i love the game dynamics even tho there is a bunch of stuff that is really hard on mobile i can co op with friends if i want to it can get a little slow sometimes i have not run out of story yet but i am currently stuck till i level up hehe but when you can actually play it it is super enjoyable
5,an immersive large ingame world and the best part its open world you are not locked to a line of locations instead you can climb mountains go fishing fight enemies and have a great time artifacts may only be the main problem as there is always the difficulty of acquiring desired artifacts otherwise this game is great in all sorts of ways and it will set you back nothing to begin playing
5,as far as phone games go and furthermore a free phone game i am really impressed entertaining engaging and lots of stuff to do graphics are great kinda reminds me of breath of the wild but with more border contrast i exspected it to be like breath of the wild actually but the party aspect of the game play changes everything i really enjoy it
3,i realy love this game but why icant log in after the update using my fb accnt how can i fix it
3,overall the game is very fun lots to do looking forward to new areas and quests in the future one major complaint i have is about the lack of controller support on mobile i play almost exclusively on pc because of the controller support why cannot mobile users get the same i would love play more on my phone but the game is incredibly difficult to play comfortably with just onscreen controls
4,honestly it is a decent game the story timeline design and overall gaming experience are excellent as well as the scenes and effects however it is loading takes a long time every time you start the game and the glitching is sometimes really annoying but overall it is a great game
4,i wish i can give this a five star well because i just give this a four star five star because sometimes it always lagged and they always kill me even i am not doing anything but i love it that is all thank you
4,its a good game i love the character designs the big world to explore and the story quests and character stories the reason why i rate it four stars since i have been encountering a problem and this problem just happened now from my years of playing the game the problem is i get lag spikes and sometimes it forces my controller to move characters and to do stuff it is hard for me to play abyss and explore the map if this problem keeps happening
4,genshin impact is visually stunning and breathtaking as a person who is not much of a gamer this made me want to improve my playing skills the story is interesting and the characters are impressive but after every update my phones lag gets worse i had set graphics to the lowest setting and even turned on developer mode on my phones setting re installed the game but it just got worse i really hope this gets fixed because i love this game and can see myself playing it for a longer time
4,i would like to give this game four stars out of five it really has everything that most of us wanted to play characters having their individual stories beautiful visuals osts etc and i loved it the only problem that i have is that i get kicked out of the game everytime i try to login which is the only reason i gave four stars please do fix this matter asap
5,edit i have been playing this game for more than two years now an i absolutely love it the soundtracks are amazing and the graphics are mesmerising the only issues i ever faced is overheating my device while playing at a higher graphics setting thought that cannot be helped considering how beautiful the in game graphics are truly amazing and i hope hoyoverse will keep up with this amazing storyline
5,it is a very interesting game and i love the character and graphics
5,i usually get bored with rpg games or any game in general and tend to uninstall them after sometime but this game has kept me for more than half a year the storyline is interesting nice graphics and character designs if i have to nitpick on something its about the progress of the story a bit slow for my pace and phone capability wise it eats up a lot i mean a lot of memory well thats what we get for good graphics
5,great game few issues with the combat system though its just tapping a button i would wish that there was more variation like maybe you could slide the attack button to the right and it would a specific attack so swiping to the right would repeat the same attack and swiping up would do a different attack etc and then you would have to find out combos on your own instead of just spamming attack and abilities also the late game becomes way too grindy but the start was a lot of fun
5,the game in general is the best i have ever played in terms of adventure fighting scenery events etc the only thing i would like to be changed is the space it takes to run if we are unable to replay story quests and scenes it should be reasonable to have an option to delete those extra unused files to have more space other than that best game out there
5,it is a great game but i have one problem during battles my screen freezes and i cannot do anything it is difficult to fight like this since the enemy can attack while i just stay there and cannot do anything
4,this might be the best game i ever played no game i have been experiencing so fun with many fitures but playing mobile is a pain when its really give a weight on your memory phone so its usually lagging and bugging a lot and many update that load really long if your phone take a bunch of your toll away
5,amazing love the setting characters the lore of course gameplay is smooth on the computer i use now it had to be a eight hundred dollars sixteen ram tb space computer though or it would not rly run smoothly on others or it would not work at all but other then that it is a rly great game there is no voice distortion in the cutscenes either like their other game honkai star rail
5,pay to win past fifty nine your stuck i die every time going on that electric purple mountain i guess i need to buy tier sixty characters through pw upgrades other than the complaints it is fun
2,my dude please make this game playable to much of a resource download and some of the devices are not compatible with game fix all that please i saw my cousin play awhile back i thought it was fun but resource downloading is to much for me to play game so could you mind fixing that for others
5,this is the best rpg anime style game ever first the story is awesome character design is awesome and cool and cute world build is great everything about this game is awesome
1,mini games and more mini games you cannot even use your characters you pulled zero qol patches or improvents since launch same formula every expansion
5,it is a fun game and it is good for exploration i played it in twenty twenty two sadly you get to have fun characters my favourite is wanderer you can fly with him you can even explore download it and start with a new journey
4,i love the game and i highly recommend it however the file size is just too big to reasonably have on my phone it takes up nearly seventy
5,the game is so good i really love this game so much but im struggling at the storage i really want to play this game until the end of the journey well ig i need a pc for this wait for me genshin i will play you again soon
5,who ever reading this do not waste on reading my rating just download the game this is awesome and game experience is amazing story exploring the area and doing other stuff i love this game but i deleted months ago because of my low device five gb is not kidding bro my phone about to explode
5,a lot of fun basically a free breath of the wild with catch a thrown perfectly able to play most content without spending a dime i do wish costs for pulls were a little lower then i might have even spent a little money myself just at a chance to pull some characters even though it is not nessicary phone controls work but it is better on pc imo as your phone can be a bit slow same with cut scenes they will not load well on the phone but are fine on pc
5,what to say about it it was like my dream come true i saw many people playing this game and i really wanted to play but couldnt because of my phone but now i can but it is still unsure to me the game is like love at first sight a wonderful and top notch game just the way i wanted it to be and yes addictive but i love it thanks to the team for making this wonderful game and making my wish come true
4,everything seems good but i still have issues with using the bow in mobile sometimes the sensitivity when aiming is not what it seems an example is when i try to aim at something but moving the screen around to adjust the aim at the enemy feels very heavy sometimes it feels like it is buggy laggy so i cannot aim properly my ping is usually green and sometimes yellow i know about the new features added in the settings for bows to help in aiming but it still does not help with my problem
2,this game use to be my favorite i loved everything about the game the graphics challenges art especially the free adventure roaming over time as my world level goes up the game gets harder but does not give you enough boss drops to get to the next accession rank so you end up getting hit with more damage then needed i loved when the new island arrived the art and culture is amazing but you dony get access to such power ups because of your level being too low so you miss out on stuff
5,suggestions hello devs i have a suggestion it would be nice if we can swiftly change our party to party with the click of a button long pressing the portrait allows to quickly configure the party setup but what if there is a button to switch between party and party without needing to configure the current setup and switch between characters that is necessary in certain situations that would be quicker and very useful it such a hassle sometimes to switch characters
4,i think this game is really well made especially since i am running it on a phone it has great graphics great game play and a great story i have only just started but it seems to be almost exactly like legend of zelda breath of the wild the part where you need to go to different monuments to unlock your map your stamina system the part where you start the game and you are on a cliff overlooking hyrule and even the way you get your glider
3,i have been playing since one point zero ar sixty and with the release of star rail the feeling of not being heard by the developers get stronger the multiple changes we keep asking for can be found in star rail while genshin still does not have them more resins endgames substats change etc and the lack of communication from the developers is concerning the difficulty of the abyss open world is not balanced compared to the rewards received the story and the graphics are wonderful but that is it
5,the game has a lot of content when you begin although it may become a little bit stale after a while the music the appearance the gameplay the characters and the story is very good allowing you to focus on what you want and not just in combat the teapot system has improved and is fun to personalize and with five characters with amazing design voice lines and distinct personalities you will end up having more than one favourite i really recommend the game just be weary of the community
5,for a free game and a mobile game it is absolutely amazing i really enjoy the storyline along with the beautiful graphics and soundtrack to go along with i also love the open map and the different actions it has walking climbing jumping swimming gliding as it makes the game feel more free and not constricting you should definitely give this game a try
3,so i have only been playing since this month and overall it is fun and cannot put it down however like many on here the lag kills me i do not have a computer and my good tablet is being repaired so all i have is my phone i will be flying and then my game freezes then my character dies out of nowhere and i have to start over same for when battling especially bosses hopefully can get some improvements that are geared towards phone users
4,it is so very very fun to play graphics and everything although i wish you can play mission during co op mode so that we could have more fun playing with other players while helping them achieve their goals missions
3,great game but needs better end game content to put our team building and characters to the test
5,this is the best mobile game i have ever played it is immersive and the developers have played a massive attention to detail the graphics are beautiful and stunning the gameplay is fluid and responsive i love the elemental aspects like ice freezing water and fire being interactive with the world a few things i would say if possible is to try and make the facial features of the characters move more accurately for more immersion i also love that the game is not pay to win but pay to have fun
1,it says i have a lot of storage on my tablet when i barely have any games on there i tried deleting pictures and some games i cannot delete everything on there because it says i cannot
4,the game is one of the best games i have played and it is free my only pet peeve with it is how you can start a quest without thinking and all of a sudden your stuck with a quest that makes you unable to co op i would like for a feature where you can call off quests mainly certain world quests and start them at another time
4,much better than i expected runs excellent on full graphics too samsung edge twenty twenty two
5,this is an incredible game especially for it being free i know it has issues with being a bit stingy with rewards and sorting out parity between characters another issue is how much time you need to invest just to get a character or weapon fully leveled and their are a lot of characters there needs to be some way to fix this as it is not the only grind in the game you have to level up so much and you are not given enough resin energy to do this
1,good game but the pity system is very hard for a free to play player i mean seventy five is pity and ninety is hard pity also the resin regeneration is vey sloww
5,i really enjoy this game so far i am usually not into games like this on a phone just because i think the controls are tricky but this game does it really well for the mobile devices it is really easy to understand visually appealing easy to get into the soundtrack and voice acting are both done really well the controls are easy one hundred percent recommend
4,i have been playing for a few days so far its a great game its an rpg that makes me wish it was an mmo it has a huge map to explore quests etc the thing missing tho is people running around mmo style and pvp this game has great potential fantastic sound great graphics very fun play elemental stuff sounds complicated at first but for me hands on helped a lot
3,il change my review later but the download is too much wow i mean i lost interest in playing this i will change my review later brb
5,ten over ten i am new to this type of mobile genre but i love everything that i am experiencing this far thank you for this awesome game the only feedback i would recommend is for there to be less of the user interface that way the full screen can be well displayed while playing without different interfaces being in the way
5,love this game it will be my favorite game for a long time period but i have one little problem which is how much storage it takes up i still have not installed the eight update it is been nine days and i have only one option uninstall and then re install put it in my sd card and reinstall twenty plus gb with my terrible internet amazing game tho i love the charecter design the quests everythingten over tenthis game is amazing like i said it takes up a lot of storage
5,absolutely breathtaking while i prefer to play on pc the mobile version is extremely well done and still very comfortable to play love being able to just pick up from where i was was at any time so so good i prefer playing with voices turned off just because some of the characters are a bit too chatty but the voice acting is still very well done and i enjoy the story so far
5,this is one of the best games i have played so far though my only problem is that the damage numbers do not show up and it is really annoying especially whenever i try to showcase my characters i still have to change devices just to see numbers and it is such a hassle because setting my devices up takes a long time i do not really mind at most times although if you can please find a way to fix this bug
3,well the graphics are amazing and beautiful the mechanics is pretty easy to use and well managed i like the lore in this world and the story but i was not able to see the cut scenes because when it is played it was always stuck and the narration audio crack somehow i will hope that this will get fix soon
5,this is one of those that feels nothing like a mobile game its open world has little limitations the progress can be a bit short lived at first but the developers want to draw out the story more gameplay is great go off the beaten path and find monsters and hidden chests discover new companions to play as through the story or through the wish system progress in character weapon or artifact level and more i am still finding out more about the game but you can play as much as you want too
5,no words can explain the love i have for this game i love the stories scenery music gameplay and many many other things this game has to offer there are certain things that can be improved of course the artifact grinding system for one would be so much nicer if we could just get at least the main stat guaranteed for a free game though it is definitely gone above and beyond my expectations
1,the game itself is kinda good in terms of stuff to do ig but i am not gonna pay ten dollar a pull for a bunch of children and maybe a dude and then get stuck pulling nothing but common swords and pointless crafting items i like the storyline overall but there is a lot of stuff that does not really pace well in the story the music is pretty good tho just wish there was a bit more a lot of times the music would just stop or be lowered because i am in the wild like what
4,the game got a lot better than it was years ago definitely worth playing love the soundtrack wish it worked on more low spec phones as well but that is asking too much
5,same types of monsters all over the map i feel iam in one location with little changes no large difference on the whole map
4,phenomenal game but it would be even better if we could customise the traveller a bit but furthermore its so awesome surprising really as the game is free with out any ads popping up lots of quests that you can choose from and easy to get the hang of you do not get bored easily sith the different types of characters and the free movement the game give to explore the world
4,the game itself is a lot of fun but the gatcha is predatory and not generous at all however it is pretty easy to ignore it and just have fun edit uses way too much storage have to uninstall
5,single player rpg games usually do not even get my attention but this one my goodness it is a good exception i know we can play it with friends but i have yet to try it the graphics are beautiful very good controls lots of things to do huge map few loading screen overall i am loving it downside is that sometimes the game has heavy lag i hope it gets fixed soon
5,best game evee character and story is compelling and the art is stunning the gacha and the whole primo farming thing is a bit grindy but i guess that is the point very fun otherwise met lots of fantastic people thanks to this game god bless
4,it is an awesome game and the animation is amazing as well the only thing that is annoying is when u want to change party members having to click so many things is bothersome it would be nice to have a fast feature that once you click an arrow or something u can have the other four party members in an instant one more thing is when wanting to pick something up u have to stand there for a while until it lets u pick it up but over all good gameplay and cute characters
5,this game is really good from my point of view it is really fun to play and the effects are awesome it is worth my time recommend
2,i am sorry to change the review but there are reasons excluding anniversary rewards the monotonous gameplay the game is really amazing when it comes to story etc but after a while it gets boring especially at higher levels there are just daily commissions and a few bosses to kill after that there is nothing to do unless you have all the time in the world it just feels like we are stuck in a loop taking the player base lightly this is both related and is not to anniversary rewards the players were disappointed with the conclusion given to the inazuma archon quest but there was no response the players are complaining about anniversary rewards and again there is no response what so ever
3,its ok i like that its mobile compatible but its really laggy and has no controller support whatsoever i tried to connect multiple controllers wired usb to usb c and bluetooth pairing and still no response the graphics are beautiful for a mobile game the soundtrack and gameplay are also notably good but if you guys could modify your game in the future so it is game controller compatible as i would prefer to not play the game with touch screen controls thank you
4,it is good tbh but the thing i hate is the optimization overall it is good it is art style writing but yeah the graphics make it optimize even i am using a snapdragon sixeighty chipset and please please make the characters chance because so it does not really that expensive so i can save money for essential things that is all have a great day
5,this game is amazing few years ago i would play this game nonstop until twenty twenty two i started to get bored of the updates and i became lazy to do the quests and only logged in for primos but ever since i saw the teaser for the new update it made me excited that i installed genshin again after not playing it for few years now i am currently waiting for my phone to finish updating the game and who knows i might get addicted again
5,the game is heavily optimised to run even on slower devices i am rather thankful to the development team for doing so it allows more players to enjoy the game on lower end devices and remain smooth and operational as for the game itself the story the graphics the mechanics are all great and beautiful totally worth the wait
5,weirdly well made the team that made this definitely put alot of work into it full voice acting smooth animation greatly detailed graphics i have it on the highest settings surprisingly well designed controls and animated cut scenes the story also is not terrible altogether a very well made game although you will need to have a powerful phone to run this on high settings there is alot of mention in the comments that it lags badly
4,the game is actually beautiful the designs the graphics music and the lore is amazing but some changes would be really really nice first thing being increasing the resin and condensed resin cap and the map markers secondly the artifact grind is very boring and repetitive it would be nice to have some other way of receiving and rerolling artifacts ofcourse some balancing patches would be great to adjust the older characters so they remain relevant with the current state of the game
5,this turned out to be so addictive i love it you are always learning more about the storyline characters and different kinds of currency and items it is easy enough to progress through the levels but not to the point it is boring i love all the different achievements co op mode all the collections it is amazing gamelplay too not overwhelming with the controls and settings but offers all you need this is especially important to me
5,amazing story characters exploration and soundtrack
5,always wanted to play this game since it came out but since i have a cheap phone and cannot afford one that i can play this game on i just only watched streamers and youtubers play the game but now that i bought a new phone that can handle this game with my saved money i finally for the love of god play this game and wow the game itself is wonderful wished i could have played it sooner but yeah my family is poorten over tenpeak of open world games
5,the game is very good the adventure the players everything is excellent for for me
4,this game is great some of the quest are hard but overall it was a great experience however when i tried to login in a my chromebook with the account i always use it kep on saying my email or password was wrong when it was not
5,this is a great game from the graphics and the map everything is perfect idea though i feel like it is kind of ironic that the main character is of the weakest characters in the game i think it might be interesting if as they explore the nations they gain more elements they can control instead of just switching and becoming more powerful
4,last year i tried playing on mobile and it crashed immediately after i reached mondstadt i even had to restart my phone yesterday i gave it a second chance still on phone i must say i am quite impressed no crashing the visuals are amazing sometimes there is a bit of lag but the rest is spectacular i love the fact it is complex and there are interesting quests and stuff tho i would play it on pc but i have not got enough space even on phone it was hard to free up some space but it is worth it
3,really addictive game amazing storyline and fun gameplay tho i have one thing that troubles me a lot that is the game disconnecting too often whenever i am in a battle in the spiral abyss and it disconnects it resets the battle and i have to start over again same thing with fighting bosses i would have gave it five stars if it werent to disconnect a lot i would be satisfied if this issue is fixed
4,the game itself is really great the graphics are so good the reason why i just gave it a four star because it is slowly becoming more like a novel game the dialogues is way longer than the actions of the game or adventures etc
5,it is one of the best i have played aside from the storage problem this is the best if you like enjoying the graphic
4,i personally love this game but the thing is that they did not care about low ar players forty five below the new event is good but the mini games you play is annoying who tf can kill sixty enemies with just two and a half minutes tf the fact that they added literal abyss in the event also you do not get to have anyone to help like five star trial or something and the buff expire fast ghurl i kill twenty two enimies in just two and a half minutes not even thirty or forty twenty two god
5,thi game is so adorable but could you please add some whicles in it so these will fully fantastic
4,the gameplay and visuals are phenomenal slot better than what you would expect out of a mobile game the story seems interesting too and so are the characters however there are a few problems i have faced in my time with the game first being that it can be a little repetitive and grindy and that the drop rates for certain characters are a bit too low outside of those two small criticisms everything else seems to be just fine
5,super impressive gameplay love the level of detailing in ever single turn i take the gameplay the storyline is exceptional and i never expected it to be open world but that just makes it one hundred x better never in my life did i imagine a game like this on mobile u have blessed me thank u i only have one issue however when it comes to dialogues between characters side quest for this matter it takes up so much time having a skip button would be nice the lag on the europe server also bothers me
3,pretty good game overall the gameplay is fun the graphics are beautiful and the music is amazing it is also the only open world gacha game and has a huge map to explore however it is unfortunately run by a company who does not care about it is community at all their refusal to properly address player concerns and fix issues that have existed since launch makes the user experience extremely frustrating
2,i have a request i have small storage and my phone is samsumg i want to play this game but my storage enough to download resources finish it its so big gb please change it
3,good graphics and story line seems pretty good love how the downloads can be done in the background ui is excellent points for making this type of game on mobile device i could think of wow as a comparison couldnt give five stars because of how much resource the game requires even on default graphic setting the game and screen laggs long loading time and disconnects from the server too often samsung galaxy note nine
1,my honest review this game has excessive ads ping always bugging even though the connection is fast always face glitching in domain hoyoverse please fix it it is too much for me
4,i love genshin impact i have played for years and the story is so captivating i love the game play style the reason it is four stars instead of five is because of all the dialog i personally do not mind it too much but a ton of players have problems with it at the beginning of the game it was short bits of dialog and now it literally takes me hours to get through it all all i ask is for it to be a little shorter or for a skip button for us i still love the game though
3,ok i absolutely adore this game everything from the designs to the world building except for the fact that i do not get to experience the full extent of the designs my issues with the game have persisted ever since i started playing firstly no damage numbers are visible on screen secondly whenever the water is frozen using cryo i cannot see the frozen portion whatsoever thirdly whenever i am close to a water body it starts glowing uncontrollably and nothing is visible i hope it is fixed soon
5,the characters places soundtrack storyline the world itself top notch seriously its unique and amazing it is a single player game but after reaching a certain rank u can join with ur friends in co op mode definitely worth it and i had a beautiful experience but the game is little hard to play it can be tiring and might feel like a chore at some point but overall it is great they have done lots of research for the characters places names etc which is very impressive
3,this game is amazing ever since i started playing it i am super invested in the storyline and the characters since the beginning but one thing i have a problem is the resin system the resin refill is the one i dislike so much the problem is that it takes too long to refill and also the cost on using it for leyline and domains and it is also so quick to be out and gone other than that the game overall is awesome
4,it is an incredible game that i have been playing for a while the controls are really good for a mobile game and i was delighted to find out how huge the open world is there is so much stuff that you discover even after having gone through an area many times before i wish there was more diversity in the characters like different skin tones body types and such instead of just thin adult and maybe a child and there are occasional glitches of the same npc during a cutscene but overall
5,this is a beautiful well made and immersive single player game i have been playing for a few days so far exploring the world and interacting with countless objects people and places and kicking some enemy hide the adventure level which is seperate from character level stunts your growth somewhat forcing you slow down and enjoy every aspect before moving up a tier this is a free to play console worthy masterpiece and thoroughly recommend to anyone looking for a solo rpg in near mmo style
5,hoyo the gb is too much my phone cannot go on much longer wth is this we are not even at fontaine yet edit thank you for reminding that i cleaned some caches a few mins ago and manage to finally download everything still love this game after all xd well done hoyo i love your game please keep it up
5,okay i as disappointed as i am about the anniversary i still have to give this game credit it is really cool and i enjoy playing it definitely room for improvements but overall a really amazing free to play friendly game
5,so i just began the game i have only got amber so far and i think it is a really cool game because it is open world and you unlock stuff as you go so i definitely do rate this a five star i recommend it it is worth your time trust me
5,the graphics are gorgeous the gameplay is incredibly smooth and i love that there is no wrong way to play you can almost ignore story quests in favor of smaller side quests if you want and as someone easily distracted i love not being penalized for not following the rules there is also zero requirement to spend money for an enjoyable experience so you are also not penalized for being unable to shell out tons of cash just to play love love love this game
2,at its best it is one of the best mobile game experiences in terms of depth the map is incredibly big and the graphics are quite mind blowing at first my problems with it are with the predatory monetization the long winded unskippable dialogues and the abysmal performance especially on android devices even on flagship devices such as the samsung galaxy s ultra even after lowering settings and optimizing my device as much as i could the game was unplayable after a couple of minutes
4,may as well update my review i would give it five stars because it is the best mobile game i have ever played it is not pay to win and it is an open world adventure with compelling plot the reason it is four stars there are some bugs i really look forward to the team working on crashes and stuttering cut scenes though the stuttering may be my phones fault for not being powerful enough there was one boss that kept charging out of bounds by itself and then resetting the encounter back at full hp
5,best game i have played in the last years i have been here since day one and never regretted it genshin managr to make character relatable and feel human while everyone is very kind in their own way even if the world looks grim
5,this gaming is absolutely amazing i was blown away on how good the sotryline graphic style and all mechanics in the game gamers can easily spend money in this game because everything is reasonable without breaking the bank there are minor issues like others have mentioned control climbing on wall or over railings on the building when not intended and camera view objects blocking the view or sudden change of direction at times just some simple touch ups will make this game perfect
5,super amazing game there is no auto mode which i extremely appreciate in games like these you do everything yourself from fighting collecting materials cooking etc the story is great the voices and animations are fantastic there is always something to do it is just such an addictive game my only advice to make the game even better is to add a more hands on co op mode so you could do quests with friends and add an openworld aspect to where you can see add and talk to other players
1,gave this app one store because this app keep making us log into this app which we really do not have to other games do not make us do this
2,i saw the add of the game and it looks very fun because i like exploring i instal it but the game takes to much time to downloading that is the reason that i gave stars please fix this problem
5,i love the game and the art my only problem is with worshipping the statues
2,i played the game pretty solidly for a while even paid for several of the monthly subscriptions and battle passes but the thing that absolutely broke me were the artifacts i have no problem with a grind i have no problem with a time sink but few things feel quite as disheartening as working for several months on a goal of improving a single characters artifacts and feeling like zero progress has been made after so long
2,graphics and pretty neat but i had to rate it low because they did not have inverted controls i play my games with the x axis inverted it is very difficult for me to train my brain to play it other way around please developers add the option to invert the y and x axis would have been a five stars if they had the option now it remains almost unplayable for me
5,i will be honest for the update now it is enough to add impressions like diving and others but it is a shame there are still bugs like exiting the map and others and there are several new missions that do not have voice over in my opinion this makes the mission boring
5,i absolutely love it the graphics the elemental reactions and everything but theres one thing that i found theres a bug when trying to fight divalin stormterror theres another one with kaeya when i use his elemental skill on the water the ice does not appear but its there pls fix these bugs sorry if im asking for too much but overall the game is fantastic cant wait for the new character
3,say what you want about the gacha system or the botw like aesthetic this game is well put together and has a deep running lore with beautifully crafted environments and unique characters however after almost two years next to nothing has changed when it comes to character variety still using the same bases they lack variety please add new rigs and body types
5,the game is very fun and intersting even though i play in a mobile device it is not that laggy and the story and character are aten over teni hope the game can be as interesting as it right now in the future
5,what entices me about this game when it was first launched is the vast open world experience you can explore anywhere and all areas is not just imagery or backgrounds the music is fantastic and relaxing to listen to while you travel plus the storyline is engaging the characters are extremely well written and has their own quirks and flaws not to mention the npcs as well i love how detailed the game is too this will always be my favorite game
5,graphics is very good and story line is best
2,awesome game but a lot of pay to play the pity system is terrible and will probably not let me build the teams i want instead i try to play with the team i have got sending couple of one hundreds of dollars will set anyone up very well free to play options is available but guess that is just a minimal thing if you do not spend even a penny on the game update after playing for a long time i quit this game because it was just making no sense as the catch up is too much if you discontinued for a week
5,all good when you have at least one ss tier dps otherwise its hard to fight some bosses
4,a very good game with beautiful graphics and nice gameplay sometimes the game feels boring and i feel like some of the characters and some of the story is pretty bad but i guess its ok eight over ten for me
4,it is a great game with amazing animations but every so often if you do not have enough data or your wifi plays up a little your phone tablet will start glitching a bit but all you have to do is close the app down turn your device off and wait a while turn your device back on and open the app and it works fine
5,it is a very good game i have just started it and it is brilliant the graphics characters attacks weapons animals and the best part storyline brilliant and from starting i was big fan of mythical things and adventures things and i even like anime so if you like mythic and adventure this game is for you
5,i was eagerly waiting for this game and when it finally came out i was so stunned to see that they made it open world with a great story the controls story gameplay graphics and the mechanics are all great the only thing that breaks immersion is how the camera suddenly faces down when we fall and stays at that angle overall mechanics of fighting is just awesome this is truly a paradise for gamers
4,i absolutely love this game it is been a comfort game of mine for years now i want to continue with this game but i am starting to run out of storage for it i love the game but there needs to be something else for storage management i have deleted many apps because of the storage but still barely have enough room
4,even though i did not l the y anniversary awards the company has nothing to do with the game itself as much as it sounds weird this game changed my life for the better started bonding with friends more escape reality and play with favorite characters not to mention beautiful graphics character design and genius voice acting wish the awards could be as good as in the beginning but still a great experience
5,besides the gacha system everything else is top notch and the developers take the community seriously and many players are friendly and will accompany you on your early days and who could resist free in game rewards right which is so so frequent and apart from that the character designs and sceneries and enemies are such a masterpiece and the graphic quality is as good now i am currently on my ar fifty six i have been playing for a long time tho it takes space but hey it is worth it
3,works very well on my mobile device textures pop in and out of existence at times reconnecting if you have to pop out of the game for a second is very smooth impressive story is very confusing from the start characters do not know each other but talk like they have interacted at least a few times before
5,love the game and enjoyed the adventure but i found a bug that happened to me twice both on cp and pc after leaving co op the game does not read the characters i was not using during co op it is like the system forgot i have other characters and cannot change in game if i swap switch the existing party it goes to the character screen but it is blank and if i go to the character option in the paimon button no character appears and the name is replace with txtcharname
5,i really like the story the characters the animation everything it has a really big potential and it is quite good to play earlier the sound glitching problems was more frequent now it became more rare also it is lagging sometimes i am not quite sure if it is my phones fault or the games fault but other than that it is one of my favourite game so far
5,it is a great game great graphics and i love the open world however i have two issues with the game it needs to be further optimized on my and poco x it faces fps drops in medium graphics there is nothing self learning in the game they teach you everything for example the puzzles of the dungeons but other than that is an excellent game edit most of the problems faced in my previous review were solved the optimization impoved and also i was mesmerized with the game events
1,the game is amazing except that it keeps on lagging the faces the ground characters buildings and items would disappear the first time i saw the dragon the whole time in the cut scene it was just lagging so much even when i fought it i couldnt even see anything on the screen anymore but i managed so the problem is either my phone or the game and im using an oppo
5,for a free to play game you are getting a huge amount of actually really good gameplay putting aside the gacha system which you definitely should investigate a little before getting into the game it is beautiful interesting enough and depending if you stay on your phone or change to pc or console challenging enough as well it does have problems after several hours of gameplay in terms of what you can do but if you are a casual player you will not even notice them do give it a try
5,hoyoverse respond to me about my stolen account issue less than days thank you eventhough i need to notice them from my google review and lots of email submissions i know hoyo team is trying their best thank you
5,when can this game be put on the switch ill love that and i lost my account and had to start over i mean i dont mind but i had made it so far and unlocked so meny characters
4,one of the best games on my phone the gameplay is the most fun aspect to me because of the element physics and its pretty fun to experiment with it especially since the devs give you five characters quickly the history of the world being able to be found in books is a great idea since its choice the only problem i have is that the loot takes so long to appear and i have to tap it slowly for it register which is undeniably annoying because i grind instead of shopping not that its needed to buy
5,this was so fun and interesting game i loved it sooo much and i even played it with my friends and they loved it to
4,it is been awhile since i found good rgp for my phone low and behold genshin impact comes along it is a great game no real problems with it but i have one major complaint why did you turn the main characters attribute to earth in my opinion she was better as wind type alot of the main and the side story line you need a wind type complete and to me you nerfed her down to almost unusable in a lot of the missions granted there are plenty wind types in the game but please turn her back
3,game is very fun and good based on experience educational entertaining and very detailed the world quests and story quests are also good fun detailed and it makes so much sense and sometimes confusing which makes me make some of my own theories only problemo is the fandom community its kind of getting toxic i hope hoyo take care of that next
4,the game is great but there are some things i want to point out lowest resolutions more like medium for me lower the resolution more please when using marksmen i cannot aim buttons are too close to each other four camera angles when in a fight are annoying it always focuses on the grass blocking the fight
4,quite fun the quests are super long and you do not earn much from them tho i do not really like the whole wish system i hate the fact that i have to pull ten wishes in order to get only new character or if you are super super lucky but it really frustrates me out as there are many people that cannot pay to get as much primogems as a beginner it is quite hard to earn primogems so it is very hard for me to actually get a new character the quests do not usually give primogems also
4,it is a great game with good graphics it is just that it is a bit choppy with the graphics since i have a four gb ram phone the storage it takes too is six gb would be an improvement for the game to be open to more people that has small storage space left i would also suggest it to work on making it more smoother for four gb phone since it is a bit choppy as i said
4,amazing game great graphics and easy controls needs some work here and there co op mode needs some work to allow players to assist each other in not just daily commissions but also regular story missions if they have anything in common or for example side quests when playing co op mode i cannot even view my missions and every domain i try cannot be played in multiplayer mode also the game should have controller input support or have control mapping because it makes it easier for many players
5,it is a really good game i love it but the thing is the space it takes i see it at the top of my list of things that take up space for my phone i think it is above a four but less than five i really like it though ️ edit since released i experience a crash in the game when i am underwater i cannot play because of it i hope this get fixed
3,the game got a lot better some bugs are fixed i hope they keep up the great work i also hope server lag issues get fixed because as a mobile player there were some instances wherw the pick up option or button does not appear quickly letting some valuable resources go away crystal fly cores and sometimes the mobs does not drop anything or if they do the drops are far from where it died or sometimes it does not give anything at all i hope these issues get fixed and give us more primogems pls
5,have not played too far yet but easily five five so far would get a six five with controller support that is the only thing missing so i have to use a third party app to overlay the button presses which results in some lag issues but that is not the games fault that being said it really is the only thing missing from me giving it a six five score please devs fix controller support
5,my favorite game and the best game ever with the majestic plot that i have ever played
1,they never improved the game or added end game dont waste ur time it will be fun for a couple months then you will get sick of it like everyone else
4,the game is so good the storyline gameplay everything is perfect but in the loading screen it stops at snowflake and does not move at all i kept it like that for ten min and still no progress i really want to complete this game it seems few other people are also having this problem after reading the forums the app developers pls look into this problem
4,gameplay is one of the most fun experiences i have ever had and graphics are of amazing quality that i have never seen before in a mobile game however i have an issue where the cutscenes tend to always freeze and crash the game where i have to restart the game constantly if this issue is fixed this will on the top of my list for the best mobile game to play on the app store
1,i already downloaded my resources but what is this when i open the app it start downloading the resources again which is i already downloaded it please fix this problem
1,i loved this game but the trails in tianqiu quest ruined it because i cannot progress thurther and i am not at a high enough level to beat it i did not even know it would not let me cancel it please add a option to cancel quests so we can progress and if you are going to not do that at least give a clear warning to show you cannot progress
5,a love this game tho r i p to me for also playing on mobile i still really love the game i wanna star saving up to get venti fontaine looks beautiful the characters have very cool and beautiful designs to the underwater thing for fontaine sounded sick even my dad loved it cuz of how cool it looks
5,i honestly cannot praise this game enough this takes breath of the wild as a base and adds all the qol you would want weapons do not break upgrade health and stamina together level ups and the freedom to explore plus one hundred percent no strings attached co op aaa games nowadays need to pay attention to this one i wish the mobile versions started with controller support but i can map my own buttons anyways currently mainly playing on pc with my sixty controller but i had to leave a review it is that good
2,the security in this game needs fixing my year arfifty six account got hacked even though i only shared my info abt my account on my close friends and i cant even get it recover
4,generally an excellent game but it comes with it is problems the resources are really scarce and even when completing all events it is hard to level all characters you want you always have to choose carefully what you will invest into additionally the late game is kinda boring apart from events you basically have spiral abyss only which is thirty minutes of gameplay every two weeks i just wished there was more things to do and more rewards for getting strong and high adventure rank
5,best gacha game out there great graphics over all and totally free to play spending money is a choice to just speed up the process with just free characters that are well built actually doing well in the game isnt hard at all however i would suggest that the mobile users are able to change button placement on the screen ability to change hud layout as it will definitely help out the mobile users to aim better with bow characters and have abit more comfort when playing the game
5,i love the quality so much but it needs more storage i risked my storage for this game lol make me sweat make me hotter make me lose my breath make me water xd
4,the game it is self is great the graphics is great the characters design is great the storyline is amazing tho now there not a lot to do not a lot of exploring all it is waiting for certain things commission events new quest resin etc and rewards you would get from exploring or from quest events is now going downhill i still love this game but i wish there were more ways to get rewards personal recommendation make the current parts of teyvat bigger like x two to x ten and add more loot
5,really awesome game i play it almost everyday the graphics story character designs mechanics the overall contents of the game are impeccable the only problem is it tends to crash on my device whenever i enter multiplayer especially during domains other than that this is one of the best games i have ever played and you will get addicted faster than james charless career flopped
5,love this game there is no schedule so can play on your own time great story cute characters lovely scenery it is some times laggy mobile and there are some aspects that are harder like lag collecting and crystal butterfly and others move to fast to catch it is very time consuming to level all characters skills weapons as the materials are either random drops or to few but over all very good game
4,to be fair to the game it really really is beautiful the graphics the open world the character and monster designs the weapons and their effects attack animations everything about the game is breathtakingly beautiful my only problem with it is that to appreciate the beauty of the game i unfortunately do not have a phone or pc with the ability to let the game run as smoothly as i wish it could based on the ads and other promos thank you for the beautiful game though hahaha
4,game is pretty great all around gameplay is fun although is not quite as intuitive as i would like and can often be finicky between switching characters mid combat and picking up bugs and fish game looks great and has a large open world to explore my only real gripe with the game is it is gacha system i realise the game is free to play and the devs need some way to turn a profit but the rates of the higher rarity characters is absurdly low and currency is just too scarce in game
4,the story line up is really good but it takes so much time to come up with the story quests for the past six months only filler quests are introduced
5,beautiful details no ads at all fun gameplay multiplayer and i like how each reigion has its own story behind it all characters have their own skill and have good designs i like how there are details on the speed depending on how tall they are but some cutscenes will not actually play and will freeze up like the one on windbloom festival no matter how good your phone is in total the game is a perfect choice for people who like adventure fighting fantasy and multiplayer games
4,amazing game one of the best rpgs i have played in years it gets buggy here and there but honestly with all the graphics it has to render at a time i dont blame it all you have to do if something stops working or if it starts crashing is close it and reopen and it will take you to the closes savepoint which also it saves very often so you never have to worry about losing anything which is perfect my only nitpick is paimon our companion she really rubs me the wrong way with her character
5,i love this game srsly from the character design over the story to the overall gameplay experience everything is just perfect it never gets boring since there are always new challenges events and quests for the gamer gamers have to think strategically before fighting enemies of different elements which makes it so much more interesting i recommend this game to everyone who likes adventures and rpg games
5,i love this game there is just requests can you maybe make the game to not take up too much storage that would be really helpful when it is saying downloading resources and stuff like that could you please make sure that when you close the app but it is in the background keep updating because i still have not been able to finish that unless i keep that on my screen other than that highly recommended
5,i really love this game on android but can you please make an option for the movement control to be moveable as apposed to being fixed i have big thumbs and i am having so much trouble with character movements especially in battle having theability to place your thumb anywhere in the lower left quadrant to move would be great also having the camera move to follow your movement so it always gives you a view from over your shoulder or back would be helpful as well please and thank you
5,it is a really fun game and i enjoy it immensely character and world design is beautiful and there is so much to discover the game is a bit large in storage space but with the right device it is super fun and easy to play
4,to be honest i have not played the game because i hate the mobile controls and my pc is not powerful enough but i do still want to play the game i was just wanting to ask if we could get some mobile controller support edit i have now played the game and i think the game is fantastic graphics are great and how smooth it runs is also great i sometimes have a few issues with the controls but aside from that i think it is well worth the amount of storage it takes up
4,for a brand new game it is really well done with only a few hiccups here an there the controls need some tuning for example adding a button for climbing would be nice also disabling the automatic camera movement would be really nice and being able to turn off auto target would be great but otherwise this game is wonderful
3,genshin is probably the most beautiful game you can play at the moment the univers is simply stunning the animations are great though i wish they could be skipped after they have been seen once like old school rpgs this is one of the points where mihoyo fails to draw from its predecesors the characters are generally well thought out and fun to discover where things get hard is once you actually play the game the controls are absolutely horrible and controller support is nowhere in sight ios has had this for nearly a year now but some of the workarounds people have come up with on android have led to users being banned leaving you to contend with very underwhelming touchscreen controls you will also find yourself fighting the engine much more than the enemies there are a number of ways the game becomes anti immersive from the constant zooming in depending on your combat actions there should simply be a way to turn off auto zoom off but this illudes the devs completely to enemies walking off a preset area mid fight where they will walk back to their spawn point and regen one hundred percent hp and have you start the fight over something to drive you insane when fighting new and more powerfull foes all in all the game is good but some basic improvements would make it much more enjoyable
4,great game just need more stores and ability to buy stuff
4,it is a nice game with stellar graphics i cannot say much about it yet it is a little laggy at times the thing i find super annoying is how i had to purge everything on my phone in order to have enough space to play this i hope it comes out for the switch soon because i would really like to play it on that and prevent my phone from exploding because of how much gb this game requires
4,i love both the game and the story but the lag just makes the game near unplayable at times the game completely freezes for a goodten over tenseconds and rare times even longer if there is some way to fix this every setting is on low lowest please let me know great game
2,beautiful game visually although it fails to keep players hooked and becomes an absolute nightmare to new players it is not well paced at all and it is easy to become bored or burnt out nowadays the updates have become huge there is no way to find any more space on my pc for this and to think there are regions still coming in the future please find a way to lower the number of gb it is insane
4,genshin is a great and addicting game but it would be so much better if you could transfer game data on different servers or play with anyone around the world instead of your designated server i have been playing for a few years now and it is quite enjoyable that request would things one hundred percent better that is just one and the only little flaw it has but other than that everything is great community is very helpful with helping eachother out and the events are fun would one hundred percent recommend
4,speaking as a pc player the game can be extremely hard to run for lower end devices and i couldnt even install it on my phone but other than that i dont have many problems easy to use controls and a beautiful environment it can get overwhelming with bunch of world quests to do but in any other aspect is a wonderful game keep it up
5,i have not played in a while my phone couldnt afford genshin anymore but i sure do enjoyed playing it it is an open world gameplay that let us explore teyvat as much as traveler can access not only that i could wish for characters i liked with variety of characters with different designs and combat style i sure did enjoy using them the game have fantastic graphics and designs i also had a fun time playing with my friends on co op i hope to be able to play this game once again
4,i am loving the game its graphics gameplay and storyline are over all pretty great buti have a few problems when it comes to some cut scenes which are glitchy on the graphics tho that could be because of my phone or my signal also idk why is it sort of clunky to aim with archers like sometimes i cannot move them to aim at my target or it just moves so slow and very little but it could be just a problem for phone either way if its a bug hope it will be fixed keep up the good work
5,i have been playing since january of twenty twenty one the game is absolutely captivating the visuals the story line down to time limited events the musical score the music in this game deserves an award from being real world regional correct and being unique is absolutely amazing some people say the dialog is too long for me it is not enough i love learning about this fantasy world and it is lore i wish the usage of the vas would increase than read only dialog that is my only gripe
4,phenomenal game graphics are top notch and the gameplay is interesting enough to keep you hooked for a long time very action packed and the fights are fun as they require tactics and skill after a point my only complain as a mobile player is the fact that the game closes if i accidentally click on another app for just a second the game takes a while to load so it gets annoying when you have to restart everytime you get a call or accidentally click on a notification
4,the game is visually stunning and defiantly something i have recommended to friends and acquaintances i love the open world aspect the characters designs and most of the story the new inazuma update is lacking the story telling and build up that monstadt and liyue were given making it difficult to feel any way towards the characters also as someone in the higher levels i find it difficult to keep the motivation to trudge through dungeons for artifacts when i get basically useless pieces
5,really the best open world rpg i have ever played i played it for fourmonths now i am ar fifty five the best open world experience i had in this game
5,whats up with the review deletion anyway love that there were a few qol changes and that xinyan was fixed seems like the backlash has finally made the game better would love some improvement for co op i do not like manually leaving the co op mode each time my friend leaves my world
4,this is a fun game at the start has a great story line and is beginner friendly though there are a few problems i have which is that after you reach a certain level there arent any more story quest which makes it boring and when you reach a higher level your daily quest gets pretty hard for a freeplay player like me events also get very hard and some of them are annoying i do really like this games but it gets boring because you are just in a loop everyday repeating everything
3,initially i was hooked to this game i usually do not play any games rather then puzzle games but this was an immediate exception after first few days it started to lag i still enjoyed it but then suddenly in one of the recent updates the game become so huge in size that my device couldnt update it with it is limited storage so i uninstalled and tried to reinstall still it says unable to download it is an awesome game but developers must think about data compression thank you
4,breath of the wild meets diablo graphics are amazing gameplay loop is fun and addicting only issue is controls no controller support and even if they add it they need to allow remapping of the controlls on pc playing on controller is atrocious it looks like the dev never played anything on a controller and just assigned the controlls randomly to the buttons
3,great game overall but it is too big i have been trying to clear up storage space on my device for days to make room for the new update but even though i have at least mb of storage left it will not download super frustrating
5,i have been waiting for this game since it is been announced the developers delivered the gameplay is great the graphics are stunning multiplayer is extremely fun and there is so much to do beyond exploring the summon rates could be better but for a free game it is alright since you can advance regardless of new units i would like to see the mobile version to support a gamepad
4,love the game i have been playing it for ages and i have never lost interest in it a few glitches here and there but over all pretty good the only thing that bothers me is i am do not everything that is out right now so i just log in and do my commissions but thats just me lol
5,winning is really hard and mostly get a five star only by pity need to save up so much and play for hours if u want to get ur fav five star
4,really really cool game but i do believe there is an issue where some of the character designs were a little off to what they should of been like how some characters were based of of poc but ended up being very light skinned other than the character design issues there are not many issues it runs a little slow sometimes but that is mostly it
5,i loveee this game so much and its great overalll though the disadvantages i barely got sleep and i did not go outside for almost months yeahh its crazy but true actually i got all the characters last banner and im grinding again but i now fixed my sleep sched and limited the hours i play so yall be careful and take care it is very addicting
5,its a great game beautiful graphics and is filled with a lot of character this game has obviously been made with love so five stars my only problem though is the loading process it takes forever i played the game for several hours and finally went off to eat and rehydrate but when i tried coming back it just took forever to load again loading things it already loaded
5,extremely fun and engaging story lines the characters and gear look fantastic and the game plays very smoothly making combat and exploring feel fluid the only thing i have a problem with is that i play on playstation and mobile and leaning towards dropping mobile because of no controller support i am on note ten plus playing using a touch screen is very frustrating most of the time this is a shame because playstation will miss out on events and promos that the other version will not like the recent road event
5,i downloaded it first because my friend kept nagging me to do so best choice ever the game has so many differents aspects that you will find one you will stay for the story is as great as the design and the coop system is really cool if you have friends to play with i totally recommend it beware you might get addicted and play ten h per day to keep up with your friends it happened to me
4,the game is very fun to play although i am always skipping the dialogue a lot cuz the fighting style is more interesting the puzzles are great it is a great game but no end game just one suggestion can we just have a choice where you can choose what you prefer black screen or white screen in the main screen after you opened game it hurts your eyes a lot and thank you if you reading this
4,its good but my device cant keep up for battery usage four thousand and six hundred mah for nearly six hours android eleven four gb ram one hundred twenty eight gb storage good sfx good japanese dub
3,the game was fun indeed but theres a certain point where travelers have no nothing to do in the game and likely would log off for example for high ar players theyre just gonna do commisions and condensed some resin because they already completed the game and theres a lot of problem inside the game where the resin cap is one hundred sixty while on star rail is on two hundred hope the developers see that many players struggle mostly free to play players
4,best game i have ever played on an android device only disadvantage is android version do not have a controller support
4,the game is fantastic amazing graphics story line characters open world type of deal and tons of things to do the cons if you do spend money on the game the best value for a buck is actually the nine ninety nine one if you were to spend one hundred dollar if you purchase the twenty nine point ninety nine pack three times you will actually get more gems then if you were to just purchase the forty nine point ninety nine or ninety nine point ninety nine pack something they should consider changing there are more two cons just not enough space to type them out
5,absolutely stunning game from graphics to gameplay to character design and story really ticks all the boxes for just about anyone i am also impressed that they got this to run so well on phones at the fidelity it is at i have already downloaded it three times on pc playstation and my phone eleven over ten would recommend to anyone
5,this game shows how far we have got into mobile gaming the graphics are good and the story is entertaining the voice acting is also excellent while the music is superb the only problem is the network issues the pings are high even in the correct server though this could be temporary and would be fixed soon i liked how you rewarded players who play this game in early release hoping for more
4,the game is honestly great the graphics are amazing the experience is awesome there is just one problem the stormterror quest now i do not know if its just me but i cannot get past the last light actuator thing by the time i get two of them in and i finish the last fight i would obviously try to get the thing in but it just disappeared i know its timed but this happened every time just when i step on the plate it disappears but other than that its a great game
5,really well done mobile game that is better than most console games really fun open world with actual fighting tactics using different elemental combinations only issue is some frame rate slowdowns that do not fix themselves without exiting the game it takes a long time to first load up but loading is miniscule after one recommendation is to have more variety of weapon drops as i have not changed weapons because i have only ever seen one purple one gifted to you
5,excellent game and history and enjoy the peace you found in the game and music just perfect waiting for the anime
3,great game but i freaking hate farming for handguards and fungi
3,not bad can tell that the story has awesome content i am disappointed in the range classes in the game i enjoy range classes the need to manually aim at the target is terrible you should consider implementing auto lock on to the targets camera view could be less messy i hope to zoom out from the character more
4,i have been playing this game for three years now and i have never had an error until the fontaine update came i kept having a note that says game files verification error and it makes me redo the entire loading again five or six times which makes me lose a large amount of time while playing the game i have been trying to find a solution for this to stop once and for all but it keeps telling me the same notification everytime please fix this issue so i can play your game calm and at peace
5,absolutely fantastic i fell in love with this game and ended up playing pretty much every day i have two play it on pc and the phone genshin impact i say that the pc version is easier to maneuver the story art and music is great i love the characters and even the npcs detail i finish playing this game for hours without interruption because there is too much to do in this game i do hope burning regen faster overall i give this game four five five
3,i cannot get past the bridge loading screen it says there is a error called error code forty and i cannot fix it no matter what i do i have tried closing and re opening the game turning my wifi on and off and even deleting and re installing it nothing will work im pretty sure its not my internet connection because everything else works perfectly fine my friend told me to download this game and that it is really good so that is why i gave it stars i jist need help fixing this bug thank you
5,having a fantastic time running this on the pc paired with a playstation controller the visuals are incredible gameplay is awesome and it reminds me of ni no kuni for free to play this is a very enjoyable game as it gives you very close to a full game experience if you do not mind not maxing out characters tried it on mobile definitely not the same experience due to the nature of mobile on screen controls a controller is a must
5,it is amazing the only problem is that it takes a lot of space but i do not mind it at all the game itself has very good graphic and the characters designs are amazing
4,i like the system easy to understand not too many functions but the story after stormbreaker seems boring well i am still below level forty so still a long way to go to finish the story i kind a dont like the default controller setting if you could allowed me to customise the button eg move attack button lower abit move the jump button upper a bit and so on i think it will be great
5,i am honestly having a great time with the game the primogems yall freely give out were more than enough to give me most of the characters i wanted so that is pretty cool one problem i have been having is that my game often times closes unexpectedly after just a few minutes of playing hopefully this is a problem on the games end and not because of my admittedly kinda trash phone other than that keep up the good work yall
3,needs an improvement while in combat or running or jumping the camera automatically moves to unnecessary directions and distracts me where i am going and what i am doing the trees and grass that appears behind the character i play in front of me does not fade opacity and i cannot see what i am doing where i am going and who i am fighting the navigation button is locked fixed but i am used to a more free moving navigation button which makes it easy to move dodge please please fix this issue
4,hey hoyoverse please add voice chat like other multiplayer games this would be a great change in the game
5,overall great game its open world character design is pretty neat graphics stunning
4,great game with some improvments left to be desired please add native controller support key mapping to the mobile version adding auto item pick up even if only for drop items would help a lot too the game is improving in the right direction and it will hopefully easier for casuals to finish dailies in less time while offer enough for devoted to do before five hit somewhere middle of next year
2,the game has used nineteen gigabytes on my phone friends tell me that its only twenty ish gigabytes however when i tried to continue downloading the resources it says that i have insufficient storage i have nine gigabytes left on my phone i am confused how it says that its insufficient fix this bug please
3,a great game but a big l on no controller support for android this is in theory very little development work to add as it is already supported on many other platforms rumours online say this may be a deal with apple to restrict that on android but that would be quite disappointing
3,i played this in pc the controls are good graphics is great environment is awesome and the interaction between environment is unique the music and sfx are on another level in other words it is very polished in terms of its environment mechanics and other things the only problem is the resin dungeons and bosses consume too much resin the one x and ten x wish is too expensive hope you make it more fair for players
5,one of the best open world mobile pc anime game character wep upgrade systems elemental system and battle system so great moreover great storyline i enjoyed playing the game
3,it is a really good and enjoyable game i like it but genshin impact have very annoying issue and that is the games refresh rate players have to play in sixty hz in the year twenty twenty three idk abut others but my eyes hurt when i am playing in sixtyhz and that is such a shame for this game
5,this game is superb clearly deserves the awards they received good graphics great storyline the animation is reaaally great and the content is worth the wait all the time a lot of people may complain about the unfairness of the game but i think it is fine since the developers aim to halt or slow down our progression especially when we are still on the tip of the iceberg there is still a lot of maps coming soon and i am excited for the future updates goodjob
4,good game been played since pandemic stopped for a year and re play it recently a suggestion is please remove or do another app for that tcg some of us not a fan of card game dont know how much space it use maybe could save some space for only open world genshin hahah thanks
5,there are no other words for genshin impact it is by far the best game i have ever played it offers real experience and the locations are similar to the real world plus the story lines are so convincing it makes you think it is real five star finally fontaine is here yay
5,i really love adventure role play and i change my review since i love the game so much i want you guys to suggest what phone brand would you recommend with this kind of big file gbs i hope its alright
4,this game is really fun it runs surprisingly well on mobile devices but i recommend using the lower settings for better ms and is legitimately beautiful in scenery the only issue with this game is that the storyline content is released slowly and over time which leaves not as much gameplay for higher leveled players the final game then will be a huge file difficult to run on mobile i reccomend but realize this game does take some commitment to get good and to finish
3,i play in a computer a windows ten and it is super laggy when ever i want to join a co op it takes forever to load like every ten seconds in the loading screen it says genshin impact is not responding i do not know if my computer is the problem but just fix this so i would not have to wait minutes in the loading screen but overall the game has good lore thanks hoyoverse d
4,great game the only problem that is why i rated this four stars is because if you minimize the game for example you are going to read a messege or text and then you are going back to the game it will restart the game but the graphics gameplay story and others are good i hope you can do something about the idle time
5,hi mihoyo i likelove genshin impact it is really cool i love exploring in the game d graphics so wonderful realistic views nature and many more i just have one problem can you put a feature in which we can send primogems to our friendsalso mora if this feature is added then it would be an outstanding game of exploration thank you in advance
5,the game is great even tho its laggy its our internet connection i love the character designs and the new places to explore in the world of teyvat so i give it aten over ten
2,i wish we can change our saved data to other server like i want to change my saved game to asia server because in playstation it is auto america server but my friends is in asia server and i cannot join them
4,the best game i have ever played totally zero ads but it can be really laggy sometimes
4,this game is truly amazing and getting better day by day though it has many bugs and features that could be fixed for a better game experience one minus my major issue is the storage this game is taking im not sure if there is a fix for it but it is getting out of hand and many mobile players are being forced to fully quit two minus on mobile most times the chat will not open or glitch in coop which is annoying but it usually comes back after a few seconds though its overall a great game i love it
4,its really addicting and all the characters are quite unique the one thing that bothers me is how laggy it is im not sure if it is because of the device im using but during most of the fights i seem to be lagging like crazy even switching characters take about seconds and sometimes it does not change at all
5,game is amazing i have never had so much fun in my life if you are gonna download this game pls do it is absolutely incredible and you will love it
5,i really enjoy this game so far graphics are amazing and the world exploring makes it hard to ever get bored the only issues i have had so far is that it heavily lags especially during battles and it will quit on me even when i have just started it up i have invested a lot of time in it but i find it hard to continue if it will just shut down on me like this so hopefully that gets fixed soon
4,overall it is a super fun game it is got me practically addicted only problem that i have is the amount of space it takes up no matter how many things i delete it still continously says that i have insufficient storage because of this i play on my playstation other problem is when i am close to ar sixty there is not much to do but commissions events or farming it gets boring now and then to log on but not being able to do much but other than that i love the game so much
2,may you fix this app please or i am reporting because i cannot play its saying i have storage which was i already deleted everything and it is still popping up on my screen please fix this app i would would give this a zero star but i cant fix it please and ty id enjoy your game if you did it has to be fix by tomorrow or today if you can please i really want to play this i think it is a cool game love yall guys
5,probably the best rpg game ive played has good sound effects character designs great graphics and amazing views i really like the story quests better it has very interesting plots and may take some time but really worth it though the game lags not sure if its my device or the game pack even at lowest graphics i lag so much give me primogems
1,game keeps getting bigger in every update it was already taking up five gb worth of space and now i got a six gb update this making it unplayable for me
4,probably the best open world exploration experience you can have on mobile this game takes a lot of influence from series such as zelda and nier and if you enjoy both titles you will feel right home here it is far from perfect star for the inclusion of microtransactions which of course makes the game pay to win i wish this was limited to cosmetics and convenience items only also wish there would be some customization options for the main playable character skins outfits ect
3,the game is good and all but i have a big problem when it comes to logging in i was grounded back in february and my mom deleted my genshin account i recovered it by logging back in to my account on her phone she then deleted genshin impact and i cannot play for five six months up until now and today when i got a new phone i downloaded genshin impact and logged in to my account i thought all my progress are still there but when i played it restarted please help me bring back my genshin progress
4,love everything about the game the graphics storyline and characters are interesting and cool wish the game was not so big though it is taken up all of the my storage space
4,a great free to play adventure rpg wth captivating exploration interesting story and customizable characters the combat combos keeps me experimenting and engaged one drawback is as of the four characters i have unlocked there is no block i can always dodge but sometimes when i am by a cliff or edge it throws me off literally and figuratively lastly there is no support for my wireless controllers but other than that a great game to play and get lost in four five
5,beautiful graphics cute characters and an overall fun and open world to explore and have fun in only problem is that my pixel xl cannot run it even on lowest settings without crashing known issue with the bad ram the phone has so i cannot play it currently until i get an upgrade or a computer even then i love this game and it is one of the current top games to play on any platform right now
4,it is a blast to play on pc but it becomes a whole other story on mobile even on lowest settings a new gen phone can barely handle the game even on the lowest settings frame drops are constant and it affects gameplay to the point it is unplayable otherwise the content in this game so far is great just hope the mobile build becomes optimized
2,i have been playing since release and the gameplay is what keeps me playing what i do not enjoy is hours and hours of dialogue you have to go through with the story quests please give a skip button for this i have never played a game that does not have a skip option for cutscenes i have requested this multiple times through survey feedback and nothing gets done everything else is great but it gets annoying when you just want to play the quests without dialogue and cutscene interruptions
4,this game has me hooked i try to play whenever i have down time i plan on playing alot once the weekend comes i only have two complaints a darker joy stick on the screen would be nice i am not visually impared and its a little hard to see download was unbearable it took all night on my phone and i had to keep restarting the download on my tablet
5,everything is fine but i want wishes and primogems so i can get a fifty fifty on neuvilette but the thing is i do not have many of them zero wishes and one hundred fifty one primogems and i also wanted neuvilette and wriothesley so bad please help us genshin players
5,what breath of the wild should have been i play on pc mostly but use my samsung phone have not had the lag or sound issues some have stated to play when not home definitely easier with a mouse and keyboard but the phone option is great to have and runs well this is one of the better games i have played of the type even comparing to sixty console games co op could be better more to do but that is the only real change i would make to it
5,i am playing this game over since twenty twenty one this game does not have any pay wall or pay win conten free to play player btw
4,one of my favourite games to play day in day out great graphics amazing character designs quality kits etc if you take things slowly you will probably never get burned out but that is only if you take things slowly if you complete quests and events too quickly the game becomes really stale as all you have to do is use your resin and do dailies if you are up for a long grind this game is great
5,this game is awesome it also is so much fun with the puzzels fights etc my personal fav is lisa and also amber they are my favs personal favs theres so much to explore in this game and theres amazing grapics im so happy i found an awesome game like this one and not one of the boring ones i love this game so so much its the best game i have ever got
2,good quality but the story is progressing awfully slowly for a game where there is nothing to do most of the time everything buyable is expensive rewards for doing in game tasks are very small after a while it becomes more work than fun which games are supposed to be i still play for the pretty graphics animations and familiar voice actors but i do not know how long that will last unless some significant changes are made
4,everything is amazing in this game the only thing i really hope they would improve on is the enhancement system as someone who looks for the best offensive stat and substat it would be really helpful to know which of my artifacts i am actually using as fodder currently i have to navigate back and forth between the enhancement screen and the list of artifacts there is no popup while hovering the item to tell you the artifacts detail when selecting in the enhancement screen
2,the game is good yes but when you are playing on a phone it is much harder the graphics and all the cutscenes can be too laggy and it kind of ruins the galing experience and their is a bug on some characters dvalin like those where their texture is messed up like they are not on the right shape it is like their bodys being pulled almost everywhere i uninstalled tje gale because i couldnt get pass on beating dvalin because of those bugs and i am hoping that thosr would be fixed
4,beautiful open world game love the scenery exploring climbing gliding through the air fighting monsters and leveling is nice too this game gives me a great taste of that for those who enjoy characters with unique abilitys weapons there is a variety free is good however a lot will need to be purchased this is the teams income understandable i have yet to fully explore the vast range of land but i am looking forward to it for free this game is worth a download and some time
5,game is so nice but one problem game not open fast i am open the game the loading is very slow some time game fast open but some time the take a time to open fix the problem pls
5,best open world game ever i like the story and gameplay is very good in mobile games this is the best game for mobile players
5,was controller gameplay removed in pretty sure i played this game while my playstation controller was bluetooth connected or am i wrong about being able to use my playstation controller
1,game not letting me play do to storage after i deleted almost all my apps and a error code pops up code nineninetyseven how much storage do i need
3,great game but the storylines are a bit basic aint it i cannot see my damageeeee
4,the game is actually really good do not let the sudden increase in bad reviews fool you obviously at the start you have got more things to do and later on when you have done everything there will not be much to do i think that is pretty normal for games tbh and i have played plenty the amount of effort mhy put into a free game the graphics gameplay voice acting music is phenomenal as a casual player who knows how to save primos for characters i want i do not find anything wrong with the rewards
4,four stars because the problem was the storage but the quality of the game is good but super laggy sometimes
2,lack of diversity i have been playing this game for almost years daily it has a good overall experience things to offer however an issue that is been here from the start and has become more obvious with new releases is that it lacks diversity skin tones body shapes weapon styles and more are very very lacking we as a community have been saying this for almost years yet get no response and are ignored or flagged aside from these issues being problematic it is just bad designing
5,i absolutely love this game the graphics storyline character and community is outstanding however when i went to log in today after about six months of playing my save data seemed to have reset if someone knows how to fix this please please let me know i have not deleted the app changed the email device or server
4,good but gradually it will be boring please add multiplayer fights like some battle royal game
3,developers really need to add controller support graphically and game play are stellar i really really like this game but i really hate touch controls they cover up the crown and make it hard to see whats going on and there is no way i can remember where on my smooth glass i am supposed to touch for things really really need controller support
3,disappointing i have a relatively nice phone but this game lags like hell and heats up my phone real fast it is hard to use the controls on a phone too also the game is fun but its so annoying to have to level up several levels to get to the next story quest i wish there was more help in game to help you learn combat skills and creating strong characters the story is definitely interesting its just such a hassle to play
4,amazing game extremely entertaining and constantly changing beautiful scenery and solid characters the only problem is the grind as you become an experienced player putting in so much time and effort for almost minimal results when pulling for characters gets extremely tedious the system definitely needs to change otherwise i love it
5,have not seen annoying ads yet the graphics even in my low end phone is superb the controls and settings are highly customizable the main story and other stories are good and well made character npcs animation is mesmerising and a good way to spend quality time with your loved ones especially in this time where global pandemic is a threat
3,this a good game the graphics and musics are good but there was a problem with my game it would pause which i was okay with however ot started to skip and freeze when the dragon appears in the town i tried everything i could think of and now cannot get pasted the loading screen i cannot keep a game that i cannot play
1,i have downloaded now cannot play because of no space so i am going to free up some space and delete this rubbish game i cannot even start yours
5,i love the game but i wish there would be a function where you can replay old events that players missed and can experience the event to also pick up on missing parts on the game lore like in honkai starail so everyone can experience it both old and new players
3,i absolutely love genshin but recently i have been having a problem the update is too slow to load my wifi is good but for some reason the dounload speed is zero kb per second it is been two to three weeks only around forty six hoyo pls pls pls fix i need childe it is his banner rn i will update this when fontaine is loaded
5,this is the best game out there but i am having problems with the new event windtrace i always rncounter a bug when i am the hunter i keep pressing capture but the rebels still escape even when they are literally in the capture circle some other rates tell about this bug to please fix it as soon as possible it makes the event less enjoyable as a hunter thank you
5,i have got to say this is one of the best arpg games that i have played so far immersive story that goes on a nice flow both the main and sub quests are well laid out the boss fights are nice and intense at times the controls are easy to understand and really like the regular events which add a bit of extra spice to the mix overall the graphics are top notch there are only a hand full of games that i can compare to its graphics there are a decent number of characters to choose from as well
5,very fun and lots to do amazing graphics and smooth gameplay only thing i would recommend would be to add more things to do for players whove completed all quests and have nothing to do in the mean time possibly more random events appearing besides that overall one of my top favourite games keep it up
5,playing this game makes me relaxed the instrumentals it provides it is really good
3,whoa so so so so much dialog oh my god why so much talking and with no option to skip the dialogue they make you listen to every last word should be an option to skip but it is not smh
2,very cheap rewards primogems including other resources and after a year no anniversary in game event or rewards given does forty primogems counts as anniversary reward
4,amazing game one of the best currently on mobile my only complaint is the controls the button layout and sensitivity of turning is not up to par for things you need to do in game this results in a lot of falling or attacking mid glide and ruining travel or a large climb i may start playing on pc till this is fixed
2,great exploration with breath of the wild like systems and better combat imo it becomes a lot less fun once you stop exploring or doing quests and start getting into endgame territory doing the same dungeon thirty times in a row is not all that fun especially since the dungeons are essentially just fighting arenas once you know how to beat it it just becomes tedious also the anniversary rewards suck
4,i love the game and that i can play on my phone or my playstation navigation on the mobile is a little difficult also making combat a little difficult i did have some trouble signing in on my new phone but afterwards it has run very well the uses of the in game menu is very easy to use and because i am on my phone it is easier to get to web based links vs playstation
4,its such a addicting app with mesmerising graphics probably my favourite gacha game out there however the only problem i have is that it takes up far too much storage i dont want to get rid of it but if my phone cant handle how big the app gets ill have no choice but to uninstall it
5,gorgeous fun and thrilling i enjoyed every aspect of the game from the graphics the incredible soundtrack to the combat system genshin impact ticks all the right boxes i am amazed by the world it presents along with its intriguing lore a diverse group of playable characters makes things more interesting especially during battles when team composition plays an important role all in all an astonishing adventure that will take your breath away if your device can run it get it
5,wow my jaw is scraping along the floor where to start the ui ux is amazing the gameplay feels so good and so far it does not look like it is being pay to winy premium currency is earned through gameplay and achievements seriously i am impressed this game is worth a shot amazing visuals audio gameplay i have nothing to complain about so far and that makes me nervous i hope the developers keep up the amazing work
1,horrendous gacha rate and rigged to get a char at seventy fiveth pulls super prone to lose on rate ninety of dropping artifact infested with def and def which rigged to upgrade def related substat when refine have a free time to add animation of party setup which is useless while basic qol like touch position adjusting or android gamepad support is nowhere to be found four absurdly unforgivable nonsense wall of text and cutscene which is unskippable five resin and extremely stingy rewards
5,impresive i thought that the underwater exploration would be very laggy but it is not it works really smoothly the lag that i am experiencing in previous update is lessen which is very nice the v is astonishing the underwater environment looks impressive and stunning keep up the good work for the next area update as the map become larger and larger i hope that the lag can be lessen thank youuuuu
5,the company puts a great deal of effort into the game everything from design story game play events music etc etc the art style may be typical but the game offers more than what you would expect this past year i have enjoyed it thoroughly though of course there are some issues when it comes to the game such as resin and slow build up of primogems overall it is a great game
1,since four update is here but the screen still crashed and cannot login to play it of softlocked in the underwater cave
4,people who star this game have a potato phone lol anyways good game the sucks i wish to skip cutscenes and dialogues the characters are muah
4,this is a fantastic game from the characters combat and story but i wish for us mobile players we could have controller support built in like use a xbox controller and such thats why its a four over five otherwise five over five game if it gets included edit also would be nice if you could lock weapons and artifacts so you do not use them for enhancement and the resin system needs an overhaul one reason every eight minutes when at least you need twenty resin to do things thats really bad
3,gave up on playing on my rog phone it runs too hot and the audio lacks bass disabling the audio makes game run hella better unskippable cutscenes the subs cannot be turned off controls to get gliding too sensitive if lagging i failed the gliding challenges several times because of camera and controls found myself jumping around a lot more than fighting during combat cause the buttons are too close together went to play pc version and am having much better experience than on my phone
4,a game i have never been disappointed in although with the huge open world maps high quality graphics and great character designs some people may not like this due to the huge space consumption and frame drop lags for some low end devices like mine it makes my device overheat from time to time but it was worth downloading i would recommend giving the option in the settings to remove some of the special effect and animations to improve performance like when switching characters etc
5,this game is a masterpiece from the visuals to the gameplay every sequence is perfect i have never played a game this good looking and smooth on android try charging ambers arrow and shooting it at a random open place you will see it falling all the way to the very end simply amazing people who are complaining about levelling up in the future stage should remember how difficult it was to level up in final fantasy on the ps back then we did not even have any paid transactions
5,been madly in love with gi ever since i started playing it though sometimes it feels like a chore but the experience of an open world and boss fights are amazing caution you would get addicted to gambling it is a gacha game
1,how is it possible that in twenty twenty three this game does not have controller support but ios does please explain that one
3,the game is great but it takes up so much space it is unreasonable i have had to delete so many other apps and photos just to continue to play the game almost felt like it was not worth it in the moment
4,its soooooo good the graphics the story he characters it is so amazing but i am sad that it is not available for macbook pro and also it takes up so much space i had to put all of my graphics to the lowest in order to run smoothly or my ipad would fry for me when the story is animated it is really laggy and freeze so much which is also a problem but i think it is my internet other than that everything is perfection d
5,it beautiful the places but my only problem is that there is some glitch that made it hard to play sometimes
4,the best game that i have played so far there some major issues with it though especially the optimisation towards my phone my phone has eight gb of ram and still struggles to render the world a lot of problems come with it characters faces going invisible buildings disappearing mobs not loading other than the game runs pretty smooth on my phone i am hoping the developer fixes this bug on the next update
3,beautiful game and i am sure the story and battle systems are very good but i never got to experience them as during the tutorial i fell off a cliff and couldnt get back up again three stars for graphics and the storyline up until the part i fell off a cliff the missing two stars is not the games fault but would recommend playing on a computer so you do not be like me and fall off a cliff
5,this is the highest quality mobile game i have ever played do not be fooled be people who say it is pay to win you can beat the game while unlocking a ton of great characters without paying dollar
5,love the story and characters just wish artifact farming was easier
2,i dont know what happened but after the update my game got stuck on update screen and it keep asking to download sevenmb of data again again i really wish this get fix cost in case of storage i still got quite a lot so i dont know the issue here if it is my phone or what please fix it developers
4,i would have given a five star review but after the two point zero update the loading on the preparing to load data screen has gotten a lot longer it is not a wifi problem i have tried changing my connection but it does not work overall the game is good and gives an enjoyable experience would absolutely recommend and please fix the loading timers
4,this is a really fun game but i had to download it on my phone as it would not work on pc the only issue with mobile is that i have large hands so it gets uncomfortable if they added the option of controller support on mobile that would be really helpful for others with large hands that get cramped from playing for long periods of time would give this a five outta five if they added the option to hook up a controller as it would make combat a lot easier too
3,nice game beautiful graphics lovely open world to explore but the dev team needs to optimize their code a lot more right now it seems to be leaking memory like a sieve leaks water the game runs fine when freshly stated but the frame rate immediately starts dropping noticeably to a point where it is unplayable and requires a restart after as little as half hour
4,so i i have too do this archon quest and it have too do a quest but then when i was done it says too do it again and i need too fix it
3,pretty great game visually and functionally android pixela i have some heating issues and aim mode is terrible because of it with archers aside from that it slows down sometimes in certain areas but not often it closes once the screen switches so do not expect it it run in the background if you want to answer a call or send a whatsapp message
3,awesome game just love the graphics and design three out of five because of the storage problem i am a mobile player and having issues in maintaining the storage my phone is sixty four gb and taking more space with each gigabyte update is not possible for me i had to unstall it for that reason but i really want to play it and i am keeping touch with the latest update i think a lot of mobile players like me is having the same issue so please do something about it i really want to play the game
4,this is a very great game i made a lot of friends here and they are very trust worthy and i am already having fun but ever since the new update came i have been lagging so much and my game started to crash but hopefully it will fix soon
5,graphics are very very good and the variety of characters that you can choose in between
4,the game is amazing and i wouldve given a full five stars for everything but during gameplay i have encountered two times when it would just freeze and the game would stop working therefore making me restart it for it work properly again besides this problem i have not encountered any other problem in the gameplay graphics or any other sort of bugs hopefully the team can fix this bug i have not reached far into the storyline yet so the fact that it happened twice already means its a problem
5,spectacular graphics for an open world mobile game the game mechanics are kept simple and the voice acting is on point a very fun journey indeed recommend one hundred percentage
4,i love the game i think it is very enjoyable and has interesting storylines aditionally the game does not require one to pay to unlock many features which is perfect for players who play for free however i am experiencing the same problem each time i complete the peak of vindagnyr once i complete it the barrier to get the rewards is not removed and so my characters die from the cold and i get a challenge failed notice
5,it is definitely a good game to play it has a lot of intriguing storylines the only downfall is that you have to play when wifi is available well at least for me i have tried several times just with my network but i get booted out of the game
5,it is really good and of course super amazing but recently i encountered an issue and the game would crash by itself i would open it and at the start of the opening of the game it would crash instantly developers hear me out and try to fix this i am a fan of this game and lately the crash has been ruining it for me thank you edit they have fixed this issue thank you developers i am loving it so far
5,shockingly polished for a game that is free had someone given me this game to play with no context i would have assumed it costed fifty for what it is with all the comparison to botw a phenomenal game in its own right gi differentiates itself with its charming narrative and streamlined and at times challenging combat its mechanics are inventive in this open world genre and best of all it is cross platform i can end a session on my computer to pick it up on phone where i left off amazing
4,i like genshin impact it is fun the story is never boring the art and characters are amazing but i do have one problem i feel like the game takes up way to much data there is almost no way to play it unless you have basically zero data taken up maybe if there was a way to change it i would be happier with my experience
5,freaking amazinggg it definitely consumes a lot of storageprobably almost fortygb now on mobile but i would say it is pretty worth it the story lines characters voice acting everything about it is so cool the graphics and the design too a really cool game that you can decide to play alone or with friends it is pretty fun and addicting and highly recommend it to those who want fighting lore games
4,it is a real fun game you can meet new characters and always find way to get rewarded the characters are amazing my only issues is that i wish there were more poc and that the game can stop crashing
5,amazing and very entertaining the best games for the year as always and i woyld love to request higher the chances for a good artifact to come and then lower the storage need since i only have a few storage left but thank you for creating this amazing game
5,best game out there the plot is amazing the adventures characters surprisingly polite players easy ish game play i got used to it lovely experince the best soundtracks inazuma and dragon spine and sexy voices 😏
3,i loved playing this game but after the most recent update it has become impossible i am rarely able to open the game without it crashing the majority of times i am able to open the game it immediately freezes or the first time i teleport the game freezes i am so disappointed because i would made so much progress i have verified file integrity numerous times i have never had issues like this before i am not using an older phone i am playing on an note twenty i wish the issue would be rectified
5,i absolutely love this game i play it on playstation and i am mind blown about this game there is plenty of free character the world looks absolutely gorgeous and is huge it controls really well i do have a few minor gripes with it there is a need for an actual dodge not sprint or block button being stun locked by enemies is incredibly annoying secondly make more than on slot available to refine a weapon give us a map of the collectables locations and finally maybe add pets that follows you
2,played it off and on for about two years now love the story art music ect but the amount with the new upcoming update is insane and there still is a lot of new updates coming at least one per year for next years with this update coming up it would take up a whole forty five gb on the phone making it just not practical to have on phone anymore unless i just deleted everything else on my phone once again it is not practical
4,it has its glitches but a stunning game nonetheless i also think that more supplies should be given in chests or dropped such as ore and materials to make equipment also think the map should be more precise there are areas or places i am trying to find that probably should show up on it otherwise it is a fun game with awesome characters
4,i do not know if i am the only one who immediately notices this but the game is basically a copy of legend of zelda breath of the wild from the graphics atmosphere open world etc to game mechanics such as stamina climbing and swimming find and cook food for buffs wind gliders enemy camps teleport towers that unlock maps but hey botw is a legendary game and it is on mobile shamelessly to say i think this is fine regardless i still have to rate four stars due to obvious reasons
4,genshin is a very good game especially for free to play the graphics are good and the storyline is intresting your able to explore the world while fighting opponents you can also co op with your friends to complete quests and missions i highly recommend this game but it does require a large data storage when played on the ohone the audio and cut scene s may tend to glitch
5,before the game freezes during coop domains and the ninth floor of the abyss making the abyss unplayable after the update the freezes were a thing of the past new events are being added at a regular and manageable interval and the events dont stack so it is not a hassle unlike other games controls are still a bit iffy still cant edit button layouts and there are still some bugs on xinyans skill they also added the single slot hotbar for pots i requested so kudos overall great update
4,i play on both mobile and pc i do not really recommend this on mobile it is hard to play there it gets laggy and it makes your phone overheat and if your on an android user it is becomes worse cause it can cause your phone to black out and automatically leave the game plus it takes up so much storage with everything update but on the positive side it is a great game i would honestly recommend it to people it can get addicting and has great storyline graphics and amazing characters
4,while i think the paid features are a bit expensive the basic experience of this game is phenomenal you get a full rpg with solid gameplay and stunning graphics for free the experience going between my pc and phone is really impressive as well progress synchronizes instantly too i will say the co op being so highly level locked was also disappointing
5,too good games with the amazing graphics and visuals feels like in an anime world
3,a great game that makes me want to invest some time into it however makes it near impossible to do so due to the energy system resin this makes especially less linear farming such as artifacts extremely lengthy with very little rewards if you get unlucky overall i would still recommend it however would also make clear that this is not a game you can easily pick up and get everything quickly alone due to special five stars that appear like twice a year at best you are okay with grind go for it
3,genshin please fix your game cause it keeps crashing for me i will rate this a five star if you fixed it
4,the game is great a bit grindy the rates for character summoning are low but it still is fun because all characters are good depending on how you play them there are some issues such as compatibility on mobile and terrain and other things taking about a whole minute to render properly which is very annoying during time challenges also the game just had it is first anniversary and it was completely underwhelming for such a great game it is still very much fun to play tho and i recommend it
5,genshin impact has blown my mind away i admit game size is pretty huge and you devs will not believe the eagerness and adrenaline that rushed through my body waiting for the download to finish then the door opened the cinematics are well done and the story quests characters environment and gameplay are all fantastic i can see the problem people are having with the graphics going bad sometimes and hope it gets fixed sound bugs are there too nevertheless so far best game in play store
4,i changed my rating from five stars to four stars still love the game but the controls in mobile is just pretty wonky ping isnt the issue but there are times where i suddenly stop movingrun while fighting or i jump when my finger isnt even close to the jump button or i couldnt dash on time even tho i timed my dash the difference between the controls in mobile and pc is huge i hope that we could at least change the layout and settings of the buttons
5,overall wonderful game that completely makes the most of each of its platforms i never thought such a high quality and polished game experience could be brought to mobile and on other platforms it is even lore impressive i have gotten lost in exploration and picking exhilarating tactical fights with opponents that should clearly outmatch me my only complaints is that sometimes the movement is a little too sensitive and i cannot pet the dogs in mondstat
3,i play ninety nine percent of the time on pc but use the android version when i travel this app runs poorly on my two year old mid range phone but it is to be expected i am honestly impressed it runs at all and that is thanks to the many graphical options my only complaint is that hoyoverse does not support controller input on android despite supporting it on ios since early twenty twenty one more than anything i find the touch controls make the gameplay feel awful hoyoverse could and should offer a better experience
1,it is fun very fun but the camera keeps moving very very slowly i cannot really move it when i got my first character it will not let me move the character only the screen can be moved uninstalled
3,the game looks really good i just wish i could get past the loading screen it always just says insufficient storage space after i have deleted tons of things pls fix
5,i was originally annoyed with the millions of ads but after trying the game it is actually pretty fun i am only adventure rank so i have still got alot to go but the exploring i have done really highlights how much effort they put into it to be just like breath of the wild while it is not a rip off breath of the wild there are some cool secrets you just stumble across whether it is treasure or a puzzle i do wish there was a quick swap for party members and that is my only issue with the game
5,this was a great game i meet a lot of people that help me it was a great time but all things gotta end my storage was low so j gotta quit playing but stillten over tengame
4,this game is truly stunning and i have loved playing every second of it on pc and ios upon getting a new phone it runs fine but the game is so poorly optimized for some reason on android that it crashes why this needs eight gb of ram for a mobile game i have no clue why i seriously do not want to have to play this on a pc every single time just to play smoothly kindly tweak things so those with less than optimal may be able to enjoy more of this game thank you
5,very addictive in a good way it feels like a breath of the wild expansion the game so far does not feel like a pay to win after quite a few hours of gameplay i have not needed to store at all i happily bought a pass from the store though the storyline is solid and has voice over the only downside so far is the adventure rank system it is not much of a downside but it levels kind of slow the game needs costumes to and an easy way to talk to other players online these are minor issues
5,in my honest opinions the game plot characters movements and even their reactions are well made my only problem is that at certain cut scenes the video got lag and only the sound went well maybe it was my phone cause it couldnt handle the graphics other than that the game itself is very enjoyable player friendly very kind in helping players and i got addicted playing it on first day playing it
5,i like the background music the scenery the story the characters the rewards are fine and i love the events so much you can earn a lot of primogems and for people who are deciding to install it go tip do not speed run the game and it is better to farm artifacts when you are adventure rank forty five
4,it was pretty good experience the characters the music and even the world its self in the game was good so far no pay to win or paywall iv seen but the bugs are annoying like animals suddenly levitating when killed or characters suddenly start flashing back and forth when changing characters the changing characters might be my phone but it is annoying since your completely frozen for a good four to five seconds why i am complaining for such a small bug because i keep getting killed when that hapn
3,this game is awesome in terms of world building characters and quests i would give a five star review if not for the problems i have noticed that make me hesitate to invest any time or money on it recently the game force closes crashes frequently and usually occurs mid fight during teleportation or when leaving an event domain building after the recent windblume event update i have for the first time experienced extreme lag to the point where i do not even want even do enemy mobs or bosses
4,i like that the world is pretty and full of chests and things to explore but the longer you play this game its getting more and more boring hoyoverse please add skip all dialogue option
4,been playing the game for months the game is good story is interesting the only problem in the size of the game if you guys want a good game with good story this game is for you but also keep in mind that this game is fortygb and they will keep on updating the game untill we reach the end of story also little suggestion dendro traveler is o p if you need a goog healer noelle is good for you she can do good damage be a sheald for your team and be a healer
5,the game itself is amazing wonderful graphics cute characters nice storyline the only thing i have to say is the lag i have a samsung aseventy and every single time i get to the part where my character and amber are looking at the sky after the wing thingy itnfeeezes and the audio cuts out i do not know if it is a wifi thing a bug or my phone simply cannot support the game edit i after i redownload the game it worked perfectly
5,unique game on its own since the graphics so high i tend to play on my pc and the way its support cross platform device are the most impressive aspect my only recommendation is to add customizable control settings option if the developer adding this feature it will be perfect to pair with controller and other peripheral for better gaming experience
4,i love the game play but the one thing u hate about the mobile version is that it take a lot of space and drain my phones battery
3,my game was great i play it on the pc too but since the recent update the game does not work on my phone i have a samsung s ten e it worked flawlessly before but it keeps getting stuck on the loading screen then crashing i have cleared the cache date and completely reinstalled the game and it did not fix the issue please fix soon i am missing out on daily quests due to not always being home on my computer but i always have my phone with me
3,it truly is an amazing game with a beautiful art style and has voice feature so you do not have to read i think though i put stars because it already took up twenty gb storage and will continue to take up more it takes a lot of space and getting five star items or characters are too rare and it is a little overpriced but in general the game is free and i really recommend it if you have a lot of storage and free time i was logged out of my account and when i logged back in i started again
5,genshin lmpact is an amazing game and have amazing story quests and side quests with nice character the only thing is just that there is a lot of loading to start the game sorry for any new players that have to go through that but that is normal
5,the game is overall great with it is graphics gameply and mechanincs although the game requires patience it is still a very fun and exciting game the only issue i have is the transportation the only way for you to explore new territory is through sprinting and teleporting nearby waypoints so i think you should add a mount system for a more convient way of transportation
4,really impressive game some of the mechanics are a bit clunky and awkward on mobile but if i get stuck something that is to hard on my phone i just mark it on my map and do them on my pc later so far i have been completely free to play and the game is completely playable with the free stuff so far i am adventure level and have yet to hit any sort of pay wall not relevant to the mobile version but i do hope they allow us to customize our key bindings for pc in a future patch
5,absolutely deserving of its title as a aaa game mobile based or not a fully realized open world with lore hiding in every corner characters who feel important to the plot and each with their own storyline puzzles challenges and so much to do the only things taking away from the experience is the extremely low drop rate of nearly every high tier resource the restrictive resin system and the terrible drop rate scaling from early game to late game
5,amazing its a little similar to breathe of the wild in that it is open world and you do not necessarily need to follow the story to some extent which i think is awesome as well as paragliding btw but you can use different wings p s i am at level ten adventure and i am hoping on being able to ride something to get around faster maybe but anyway ten over ten
5,great rpg and i really love that you can connect your account on the phone to your pc or playstation account and pick up where you left off also i love that you can have english voices for the characters just wish that if you use a controller on pc that the game would remember it so i do not have to set it to controller each time i boot it up but that is not a huge issue great game overall best free rpg game i have played
5,fantastic game so far controls are great graphics are even better some glitches here and there but they are getting fixed as the game progresses and new content comes in quite frequently there are ways to quickly farm in game currency primogems so that even if you are not willing to spend money on it you will still be able to obtain good characters only gotcha it is difficult to be really effective with this combat system so be prepared to study and experiment a bit
5,so far i am enjoying this game i love the story line you get to change characters which is awesome we get an option to change voice language amazing and text language so you can separate two languages character design is cute one thing is inconvenient is that we do not get to autorun to a quest location lastly i know they have monthly pass but it would be great if they have a lifetime pass that i could buy just to show support for the game as well as getting benefit in doing so
5,the only problem is that you need internet even in the offline stuff but other then that it is awesome
5,nice storyline lots of adventure quests i am not a big game person but the controls are easy to adjust to and really easy to get into i play casually on the mobile version but this game is also good on pc you do not have to pay to level up your characters it can easily be done without there is new updates and lots of opportunities to gain primogems and other resources
3,the characters designs are soo good but sometimes my game just lags and genshin just closes like the app closes the loading screen takes too long as well but it is a good game tho
3,firstly you would want a phone with gb or more to play this it will take eight gb to install and will increase in the future the game is exceptionally well made for a phone game except for lip syncing which is atrocious the monetization is very heavy handed with almost every scheme in display gacha battle pass xp etc while it is possible to finish the game without spending money the mtx makes your life a heck of a lot easier with less grinding
1,hate that you cannot skip the storyline so you are stuck reading dialogue that i am not interested in cannot collect items or chests my friends world and have it count in my world makes exploring and having fun with friends boring because i have to collect the items again in my world most other games have this availability there is so much i cannot do in co op mode like events or quests which makes it boring
5,great game so far which i would say easily surpasses most mobile games i have played the controls on a mobile screen are sometimes hard to work with but it is great that you can play this game on a pc as well to help mitigate that voice acting is decent and i love that i can choose a different language for the audio vs subtitles highly recommended but also very addicting so beware
5,controls gameplay and graphics are all five stars but i am only rating it four stars because of the systems that are unoptimized they have to fix their resin system and the way that you can only progress with resin they have to add more ways to spend our time in the endgame because it is only a five minute playtime once you get to the higher level in short more content and better systems
5,the details is very nice and i really like this game i play it everyday and paimon is so cute
